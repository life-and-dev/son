# About the author

My journey with faith has been anything but conventional. From atheism to exploring various Christian traditions including megachurches to house churches with envolvement in various traditional protestants, charismatic and messianic congregations. I've spent years asking questions about God, the Bible, and what it truly means to follow Christ.

## A Shared Journey of Discovery

Throughout this journey, I've become increasingly fascinated by what the Bible teaches about Jesus.

This website is the fruit of that ongoing exploration. I'm still learning, still discovering new depths in familiar passages, and still amazed by how much there is to understand about [our Father God](https://ofgod.info) and His [son](https://son.ofgod.info) Jesus who is the Christ and our Lord.

### The Heart Behind This Website

My intention is to draw a clear distinction between **God the Father** and **the Son of God**. I have no intention to blaspheme God or to uncrown the Lord Jesus, but instead to **glorify both in their rightful positions**.

The central problem I'm addressing is that Christianity often mixes the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit's roles, nature, and character. This confusion makes many [Bible scriptures](https://word.ofgod.info) very challenging to interpret and leaves Christians uncertain about fundamental truths.

### The Purpose: Back to Basics

This website exists to help Christians understand:
- **How to worship God correctly** — recognizing the Father in His proper position
- **How to follow (be obedient to) Jesus correctly** — honoring the Son in his unique role as Lord and Christ
- **What the true Godhead (Trinity) really is** — clarifying the distinct persons and their relationships
- **What Jesus' sacrifice truly meant** — understanding the full scope of redemption

By returning to the biblical foundations, we can resolve confusion and gain clarity on passages that seem contradictory when the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are not properly distinguished.

You'll find here careful attention to biblical texts, exploration of themes that address these distinctions, and honest wrestling with questions that many of us have wondered about. 

### Full Transparency

I write independently, not affiliated with any church or organization, and without sponsorship. This freedom allows me to follow where God's word leads without institutional constraints.

I encourage you to critically evaluate everything your read. Not just on this website, but always pray about any Christian content from any source you receive. I admit that I have been [wrong before](disclaimer.md), and I'll likely make more mistakes. That's why I genuinely invite you to [correct my errors](edit.md) when you spot them. Your wisdom, your insights, and your questions make this a richer resource for everyone who visits.

### An Invitation to Explore

Some topics might be unfamiliar. Some interpretations might differ from what you were used to. That's part of the journey toward clarity.

Rather than asking you to accept my conclusions, I invite you to examine the Bible for yourself. The content here is designed to point you back to God's word, to raise questions worth pondering, and to provide tools for your own bible study.

As you explore this site, I encourage you to:
- Test everything against the Scripture (Acts 17:11)
- Ask the Holy Spirit for wisdom and discernment
- Engage thoughtfully with ideas that might be new to you
- Share what you discover with others

Whether you read one article or explore the entire site, my prayer is that it draws you closer to God's love and your position in His eternal Kingdom.

Join me in this journey of discovery, exploring together what it means be part of the eternal family of God.
