# Son of God

**What is the true nature of Jesus Christ?** For two millennia, Christians have wrestled with this central question. Is Jesus God Himself who walked among us? Or is He the Son of God, distinct from the Father? This isn't just an academic debate. It shapes how we understand God's love, Jesus's sacrifice, and our own relationship with the divine.

I've encountered believers on both sides of this theological divide, each passionately convinced by their interpretation of Scripture. Some call Jesus "God the Son," co-equal and co-eternal with the Father. Others see Him as "the Son of God," a man empowered by God to accomplish His redemptive plan. Both groups claim biblical support, both worship genuinely, and both seek to honor Christ.

What troubles me most is how this question divides the body of Christ. Accusations of heresy fly in both directions. Yet when I read the Gospels, I see Jesus converting people without requiring them to understand complex Trinitarian formulas (Luke 7:36-50; Acts 2:14-47). Salvation seems tied to faith in Jesus as the Christ, but does "Christ" mean God incarnate, or God's anointed human representative?

## History of the Christianity

[The Church History](https://eternal.family.net.za/kingdom/church/history) indicates that initially [Christianity](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/christian) was considered [a minor sect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Christianity) among many pagan religions. However, by the fourth century, Christianity spread so much that the pagan Roman Emperor Constantine decided to support it. This enabled Christians to build [state-sponsored church structures](https://eternal.family.net.za/kingdom/church/history/constantine) and institutional hierarchies to establish order among the citizens. 

However, to encourage Christianity and to restore peace in the empire, certain aspects got [merged with pagan religions](https://eternal.family.net.za/kingdom/church/history/constantine). For example, Jesus was considered the emperor's sun god so that both Christians and pagans have the freedom to continue their traditions. 

This led to [great debates about the divinity of Jesus](https://eternal.family.net.za/kingdom/church/history/1st-nicaea-creed). Bishop Arius challenged the view that Jesus was co-eternal with God. These debates caused a split in the church such that Arius's less popular view was considered Arianism.

A few decades later, [Arianism spread to the gothic nations](https://eternal.family.net.za/kingdom/church/history/arianism). This motivated the Nicene Christian Roman state to associate Arianism with their enemies such that in July 381, the First Council of Constantinople expanded [the Nicaea Creed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicene_Creed) to [address Arianism disputes](https://eternal.family.net.za/kingdom/church/history/sundays). This version clearly defined [the Trinity doctrine](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/doctrines/trinitarian) and proclaimed Jesus as God and as such the first Latin Bible ([Vulgate](https://eternal.family.net.za/kingdom/church/history/vulgate)) was translated in 382 in favour of the Nicaea Christianity's views.

A few centuries later the "Arian" nations were either destroy or converted by the Roman Empire. As a result, Arianism among many other religions was gradually rooted out during [the Dark Ages](https://eternal.family.net.za/kingdom/church/history/dark-ages).

Since the fourteenth century, the Nicaean Bible was [translated into vernacular](https://eternal.family.net.za/kingdom/church/history/wycliffe) languages to reduce dependence on the state church and to support reformations.

Today, the [majority](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/interpretations/rebuttals#majority) of Christian churches still base their [Trinitarian doctrines](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/doctrines/trinitarian) on those of the early church fathers of Nicene Christianity's creeds and the Vulgate. While certain [Unitarian movements](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/doctrines/unitarian) continue to challenge these views. Each denomination obviously [translated the Bible in favour of their own interpretation](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/translations), therefore one cannot prove the divinity of Jesus from isolated bible verses alone. For example the NIV translate Titus 2:13 that *"Jesus is our great God"*, while [many other bibles translate it differently](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/as-god/saviour#titus-2-13).

## Bible Translations

Popular Trinitarian biased bible translations include: All the Catholic bibles as well as the ASV, BSB, CEV, CSB, ERV, ESV, GNT, HCSB, ISV, KJV, LSV, NASB, NET, NIV, NKJV, NLT, SLT, WEB, WORD, YLT, and so forth.

Less popular Arian-biased bible translations include:
* NEV used by the Christadelphians
* NWT used by the Jehovah's Witnesses

Unpopular Unitarian-biased bible translations include: 
* Belsham's Unitarian New Testament and Newcome's Translation used mainly for historical theological studies
* [REV](https://www.revisedenglishversion.com/) used by Spirit & Truth Fellowship International

Fortunately, today we have access to interlinear bibles that provide word-by-word translations of Hebrew and Greek manuscripts that pre-dates the Vulgate and Nicene Creed. Some of these can be found online at websites like [Bible Hub](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/), [Blue Letter Bible](https://www.blueletterbible.org), [STEP Bible](https://www.stepbible.org) and [Bible Study Tools](https://www.biblestudytools.com) or downloaded from [Berean Bible](https://bereanbible.com), [MySword](https://www.mysword.info/) and [Scripture4All](https://www.scripture4all.org). 

### Concerns

Some [Trinitarian](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/doctrines/trinitarian) traditions have historically labeled [Unitarian](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/doctrines/unitarian) beliefs as ["heretical"](https://eternal.family.net.za/chuch/evolution#the-first-nicaea-creed) or even ["antichrist"](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/as-god/incarnation#1-john), teaching that one cannot be [saved](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/saved) without believing [Jesus](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence) is [God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god) Himself, as stated in certain church creeds.

However, the Bible records:
* Jesus converted a woman [without telling her that he is God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/salvation) (Luke 7:36-50).
* Peter converted 3000 people [without telling them that Jesus is God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/salvation) (Acts 2:14-47).
* Paul converted many people [without telling them that Jesus is God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/salvation) (Acts 13:13-44; 17:22-34).

From a Unitarian viewpoint, the Trinitarians are [idolising](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/idolatry) Jesus. Jesus never said that he *"is"* the Father, but rather that [he **represent** the Father](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/as-god/similarities) as [His Son](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-god). That is why [Jesus act under the authority of God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/essence/not-god/serve-god) as our [Lord](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/as-god/lord).

### God's glory

Both groups agree that [the purpose of the creation](https://eternal.family.net.za/creation) is to [glorify](https://eternal.family.net.za/creation) God.

Which version gives the most glory to God?

| God allowed people to torture His human-part, but He Himself, did not really suffer anything                 | *For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son...* (John 3:16); God has no pleasure in death (Ezekiel 18:32, 33:11) especially in His beloved Son. This was necessary to save the world (John 3:16-17; 1 Timothy 2:3-4). |
| God faked His "death" because God is immortal (Daniel 9:24-27; Zechariah 13:7-9 & Mark 14:27; Matthew 26:31) | Jesus, as a distinct man from God, [really suffered and died](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-man/prophecies#jesus-would-die).                                                                                                                       |

Instead, His Son became cursed with sin (Galatians 3:13; Isaiah 53:6; 1 Peter 2:24)                                                            |
| God [violated natural laws](#incompatible-attributes) by "shape-shifting" or reincarnation                   | God never changes (Malachi 3:6; James 1:17) and God never lies (Numbers 23:19; Titus 1:2)                                                                                                                                                |
| God only pretended to be real human like us                                                                  | God does not lie (Numbers 23:19; Titus 1:2)                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Evidence

### Prophecies

Moses prophesied:

> “The LORD your God will raise up for you **a Prophet like me** from your midst, from your brethren. Him you shall hear, according to all you desired of the LORD your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, nor let me see this great fire anymore, lest I die.’
>
> “And the LORD said to me: What they have spoken is good. I will raise up for them **a prophet like you from among their brethren**, and will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him. And it shall be that whoever will not hear My words, which he speaks in My name, I will require it of him.
>
> -- Deuteronomy 18:15-19 (NKJV)

Jesus quoted this prophecy himself:

> So Jesus said to them... "For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote of me. But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?" -- John 5:19,46-47 (ESV)

This interpretation of the prophecy was also confirmed by Peter (Acts 3:22-26). 

In addition, it was also prophesied:
* that the Christ would be a human as promised to Adam and Eve (Genesis 3:15) and Moses (Deuteronomy 18:15-19 & John 5:46-47, Acts 3:22-26) 
* that the Christ would be a Jew (Jeremiah 30:21; Micah 5:2-5; Matthew 2:5-6) because his forefathers would be Judah (Genesis 49:10; Jeremiah 30:21; Micah 5:2-5 & Matthew 2:5-6) and Jesse (Isaiah 11:1)
* that the Christ would be born (Psalm 2:7) and confirmed by (Acts 13:16, 32-33)
* that the Christ would have a God (Psalm 110:1; Micah 5:2-5 confirmed by Matthew 2:5-6; Matthew 22:41-46 (ESV); Mark 12:35–37; Luke 20:40–44)
* that the Christ would serve his God (Psalm 16:8-11 confirmed by Acts 2:22,25-34; Isaiah 42:1-4 confirmed by Matthew 12:15-21; Isaiah 52:13-53:12 confirmed by Luke 22:37)
* that the Christ would be distinct from God (Psalm 110:1 confirmed by Mark 16:19)
* that the Christ would depend on his God (Isaiah 11:1-2; 42:1-2; 61:1)
* that the Christ would be anointed by [the LORD](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/father/name) God (Isaiah 61:1-2 confirmed by Luke 4:17-21)
* that the Christ would be sent by [the LORD](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/father/name) God (Isaiah 61:1-2 confirmed by Luke 4:17-21)

Now, some may argue that Christ is just "God's human body" or the "man"-part of God like an avatar. However, some prophecies picture interaction between the Christ and God as [distinct persons](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/distinct), for example Daniel 7:10-14,27; Revelation 1:1,4-5

In addition, some prophets saw visions where God and Christ was positioned at different locations at the same time, for example:

* [Jesus presented himself while God was seated on His throne](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/father/ancient-of-days) (Daniel 7:9,13)
* [Jesus stood next to God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/distinct#stephen) (Acts 7:55-56)
* [Jesus stood while God was seated on His throne](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-man/prophecies) (Revelation 4:2,5:2-6)

### Introducing Jesus

The book of Matthew starts with an ancestor registry (Matthew 1:1-17) to prove that Jesus was the expected Christ born from the prophesied family lineage. Matthew even uses the word Greek ["genesis"](https://biblehub.com/greek/1078.htm) (beginning) to describe when Jesus's life began. This is usually translated as "birth" in Matthew 1:18, but at that moment when Mary was conceived, Jesus was not born yet.

Mark 1:1 introduces Jesus as ["the Son of God"](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-god) which implies [he is not God Himself](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god).

Luke 1:26-35 mentions a human son that Mary would give birth to. Gabriel is silent about the divinity of this son.

However, Trinitarians often quote John 1 to prove Jesus's divinity. They argue that ["the Word"](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/as-god/word) is Jesus in John 1 and according to them: *John describes how God [reincarnated](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/as-god/incarnation) into flesh*. However, they often ignore John 1:18 that states *"No one has seen God at any time"* after *"the Word became flesh"*. John was not confused, nor was John writing poetic literature. John was giving a testimony and the first point that John was making was that Jesus's birth was [God's word](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/word) (promise) that He made since the beginning (John 1:1-2). Jesus was no accident from an unmarried couple (John 1:13; 8:41), but instead God kept His word (promise) such that His plan realised ("became flesh") with Jesus (John 1:14). The fact that people also mistook John for the Christ proves that a human Christ was expected (John 1:6-8,15,19-28).

Paul also introduces the Son as a human Christ that fulfilled the prophecies (God's word):

> The gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh... -- Romans 1:1-3 ESV

The term, ["the word"](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/word) is used multiple times throughout the book of John and the gospels, but it always refers to something someone had said. John was not giving a clever word puzzle, but instead the purpose of his book was to give a testimony of Jesus, therefore one would expect that the meaning of "the word" should be consistent throughout this testimony.

Acts starts with Jesus leaving his disciples behind to return to God. This by itself proves that [Jesus is distinct from God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/distinct) and that Jesus is not omnipresent like God.

Every letter of Paul, start with an introduction that mentions both God and Christ as [distinct persons](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/distinct), for example:

> Blessed be the **God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ**... -- Ephesians 1:3 (ESV)

1 Peter, opens with a blessing: "Blessed be **the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ!**" This states that [Jesus has a God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god) Who is a distinct [Father](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-god/parent) to him.

The other authors also introduce Jesus [distinct from God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/distinct), for example:

* The book of Hebrews starts with: "Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, **but in these last days He has spoken to us by His son**"
* The book of James starts with: "James, a servant of God **and** of the Lord Jesus Christ."
* The book of 1 John explains at the beginning that the purpose of the book is: "... so that you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father **and** with [His Son Jesus Christ](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-god/parent)."
* The book of Jude starts with: "Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James. To those who are called, beloved in God the Father **and** kept for Jesus Christ."
* The book of Revelation starts with: "The revelation of Jesus Christ, **which God gave him** to show to his servants the things that must soon take place."

### Jesus' identity

The phrase "***a*** son of man" refers to any general human throughout the Hebrew Old Testament, for example Numbers 23:19; Job 25:6, 35:8; Psalms 146:3; Jeremiah 49:18,33; Ezekiel 2:1,3,6,8; Daniel 8:17

But "***the*** Son of Man" refers to the prophesied [Christ](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/christ). "Man" refers to "Adam" (Genesis 1:27; 2:7-8,15-23) and [God gave His word](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/word) in Genesis 3:15 on what the Christ as "the woman's offspring" will accomplish. This term is also used in Daniel 7:13 in his prophecy about Christ. This highlights that the Jews expected [a human Christ](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-man/human). Throughout the Gospels Jesus repeatedly referred to himself as "***the*** Son of Man" (Matthew 13:41), which implies he is "the" prophesied **man** (Matthew 16:27-28; 24:37-44; Luke 17:22-30).

The phrase "God as the Son" does not exist in the Bible. However, many have identified Jesus as "the Son of God", for example:

The way people interacted and treated Jesus also hint that they did not believe he was God, for example:
* [Jesus close disciples doubted Jesus.](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-man/human#jesus-own-disciples-treated-him-like-a-human) (Matthew 14:25-33; Mark 6:35-37)
* [Judas Iscariot sold Jesus.](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-man/human#jesus-own-disciples-treated-him-like-a-human) (Matthew 26:14-16; Mark 14:10-11)
* [Jesus close disciples forsook him, which shows they did not believe he was in control as God.](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-man/human#jesus-own-disciples-treated-him-like-a-human) (Matthew 26:34-35; Mark 14:27-29)
* [Jesus close disciples did not take him seriously.](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-man/human#jesus-own-disciples-treated-him-like-a-human) (Mark 14:32-42)
* [Peter argued with Jesus, something you do not do with your God.](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-man/human#jesus-own-disciples-treated-him-like-a-human) (John 13:8-17)
* [Thomas did not believe that Jesus was omnipresent.](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-man/human#jesus-own-disciples-treated-him-like-a-human) (John 14:8-9)
* [Peter denied Jesus, which shows he did not believe Jesus was in control as God.](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-man/human#jesus-own-disciples-treated-him-like-a-human) (Luke 22:55-62; John 18:15-18)
* [The disciples were surprised to see Jesus alive, which shows they did not believe he was an immortal God.](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-man/human#jesus-own-disciples-treated-him-like-a-human) (Luke 24:13-32; John 20:25)

Now, some argue that Jesus had a "dual-nature" as "the Son of Man" and "the Son of God". If this was true:
* then Adam would also have a "dual-nature" as "the son of God" (Luke 3:38) and
* Jesus would have been his own Father (Matthew 3:16-17; Mark 1:9-11; 9:7; Luke 3:21; John 1:51; 2 Peter 1:16-18; 1 John 5:20)

Instead:

* Jesus said that [he is a man](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-man/human) (John 8:39-40)
* Jesus said that [he is not God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god#jesus-denies-being-god) (Matthew 19:17; John 5:19,43-47; 8:49-50,54; 17:1-3)
* Jesus said that [he has a God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god#jesus-has-a-god) (John 20:17) 
* Jesus [prayed](https://eternal.family.net.za/life/prayer) to [his God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god#jesus-has-a-god) (Matthew 5:45-6:9; 26:39,42,53; Luke 6:12; John 11:41, 17:1)

The term ["only-begotten son"](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-god) comes from the Greek words [monos](https://biblehub.com/greek/3441.htm) (alone) and [genos](https://biblehub.com/greek/1085.htm) (offspring) which could technically mean "the only offspring of God". Jesus was not just another ["son of God"](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/sons-of-god) like Adam, Israel and many others. Jesus was "the only-begotten son of God" (John 1:14; 3:16 (KJV); 1 John 4:9 (KJV)) which implies he must have inherited something directly from God at his conception. This is significant because:

* It means Jesus did not inherit sin from Adam (1 Peter 2:22; Hebrews 4:15; 1 John 3:5), because his Father was God Himself.
* It means Jesus accurately represented the Father (John 8:19,55) as His Son, unlike any prior prophet.

### Interaction with Jesus

If the Father and the Son were two different modes of God (the way God represent Himself), then we would expect no interaction between these two modes as distinct persons. Yet, there are many examples of God and Jesus interacting with each other, for example:

* [God anointed Jesus](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/distinct#john) (Acts 10:38)
* [God publicly declared His love for Jesus](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-god/parent) (Matthew 3:16-17; Mark 1:9-11; Luke 3:21; John 1:51)
* [God publicly glorified Jesus](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/distinct#god-publicly-glorified-je) (John 12:27-28)
* [God resurrected Jesus](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/as-god/resurrected) (Acts 2:32, 13:30, 17:30-31; Romans 10:9; 1 Corinthians 15:15)
* [God separated Himself from Jesus](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/distinct#jesus-and-god-were-separated) (Matthew 27:46; Mark 15:34)
* [Jesus cried to God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/distinct#jesus-and-god-were-separated) (Matthew 27:46; Mark 15:34)
* [Jesus grew in favour with God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/distinct#jesus-grew-in-favour) (Luke 2:52)
* [Jesus mediates between man and God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/distinct#paul) (John 14:6; 1 Timothy 2:5)
* [Jesus prayed to God](https://eternal.family.net.za/life/prayer) (Matthew 5:45-6:9; 26:39,42,53; Luke 6:12; John 11:41, 17:1)
* [Jesus returned to God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/distinct#mark-saw-jesus-distinct-from-god) (Mark 16:19)
* [Jesus served God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/serve-god) (John 17:1-3; Acts 3:13, 4:27-30; Romans 6:10; 1 Corinthians 11:3, 15:28)
* [Jesus witness with God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/distinct#jesus-witness-with-god) (John 8:17-18)
* [Jesus worshipped God](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/worship) (by keeping feasts Luke 2:41-42; Matthew 26:17-20; John 7:1-10)

### Incompatible attributes

It is a paradox to claim that Jesus is simultaneously 100% God and 100% human because these attributes are incompatible:

| God                                                                                                  | Jesus                                                                                                                 |

| God is metaphorically "the Vinedresser" (John 15:1-9)                                                | Jesus is metaphorically "the vine" (John 15:1-9; Zechariah 3:10)                                                      |
| God does not dwell on earth (1 Kings 8:27)                                                           | Jesus did, and he will return again (Acts 1:11)                                                                       |
| God is omnipresent (Psalm 139:7-10; Ephesians 4:6; Revelation 19:6)                                  | Jesus left (John 14:2-4, 16:28); Jesus is not in the world (John 17:11, 13); Jesus was not present (John 11:14-15)    |
| God is almighty (Genesis 17:1, 28:3, 35:11, 43:14, 48:3, 49:25; Job 11:7; Luke 1:37)                 | Jesus works are limited (John 5:19; 14:12)                                                                            |
| God sees everything (Proverbs 15:3; Psalm 139:7-10; Matthew 6:4,18)                                  | Jesus did not notice that they mixed gall with his drink (Matthew 27:33-34)                                           |
| God knows everything (Genesis 22:14; Psalm 139:1-6; Isaiah 40:13-14, 42:9; 48:5; Matthew 6:8,32)     | Jesus had limited knowledge (Matthew 24:36; Mark 13:32; John 7:16; 8:28; 14:24; Hebrews 5:8)                          |
| God does not repent (Numbers 23:19) and has always been holy (Psalm 99:3; Isaiah 6:3; Habakkuk 1:13) | Jesus was baptised with a "baptism of repentance" (Mark 1:9; Acts 19:4) and [sanctified](#jesus-was-sanctified)       |
| God does not sleep (Psalm 121:4)                                                                     | Jesus slept (Matthew 8:24; Mark 4:38)                                                                                 |
| God is immortal (Romans 1:22-23; 1 Timothy 1:17)                                                     | Jesus was weak (Matthew 4:11; Mark 1:13; Luke 22:43) and died (1 Corinthians 15:1-8; Romans 10:9; Revelation 1:17-18) |
| God maintains the universe (Matthew 6:26; 7:11; 10:29; James 1:17)                                   | Jesus never made such claims. If God had died, the universe would have been unattended for a period.                  |
| God adopts believers as children (Psalm 48:5)                                                        | Jesus accept believers as brothers or sisters (Matthew 12:50, Romans 8:17)                                            |
| God, is the God of Jesus (John 20:17; Matthew 27:46; Mark 15:34)                                     | Jesus is the [servant of God](#jesus-serves-god) (John 3:16-18, 4:34, 6:57, 8:29, 14:24, 17:1-3; 1 John 4:14)         |

| Nobody instructs God (Isaiah 40:13-14; Romans 11:34)                                                 | Jesus was instructed by the Spirit (Matthew 4:1; Mark 1:12; Luke 4:1-2)                                               |

#### Jesus serves God

Trinitarians believe that [the Son is "equal" to the Father](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-god/similarities), but this clash with [the Bible](https://wordofgod.info), because:

* Isaiah prophesied that the Christ would be God's servant (Isaiah 42:1, 52:13-53:12).
* Jesus himself said that he was "sent" (commissioned) by the Father (John 3:16-18, 4:34, 6:57, 8:29, 14:24, 17:1-3; 1 John 4:14). This implies the Father has more authority than Jesus.
* Jesus obeys the Father (John 4:34, 5:19, 6:38, 8:55, 10:37, 14:31).
* Jesus trusted (depends on) God (1 Peter 2:23 ESV,HCSB) or Jesus stayed committed to God (1 Peter 2:23 ASV,KJV,NET,REV,YLT)

Now, some Trinitarians will argue that it was only the human-part of Jesus that served God and that it is no longer the case because Jesus is now exalted. If this was true, Jesus would not need to pray to God after he was exalted (​Luke 24:30).

Paul who wrote his letters after Jesus' exaltation, teaches that even though Jesus is our Lord in his exalted state, Jesus still intercedes for believers (​Romans 8:34). This would not have been necessary if he was God himself. 

In addition Paul also wrote that Jesus still submit and serve God (1 Corinthians 3:23; 11:3; 15:28; Romans 6:10). Even Peter confirms this (Acts 3:13; 4:27-30 ESV), although some translations translated ["servant" as "child"](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-god/parent).

#### Jesus was sanctified

The Greek word "[hagiazó](https://biblehub.com/greek/37.htm)" translated as "[consecration](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/sanctification)" or "[sanctification](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/sanctification)" mean:

* to make holy (purify)
* to treat as holy (dedicate)
* to set apart as holy (separate)
* to consecrate (complete holiness process)

For example Paul urges husbands to sanctify their wives (Ephesians 5:25-27).

God had always been [holy](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/holy) (Psalm 99:3; Isaiah 6:3; Habakkuk 1:13). There was no time when God was unholy or needed purification or dedication to complete some holiness process like Jesus who was baptised with the "baptism of repentance" (Mark 1:4; Acts 13:24; 19:4) to "fulfil all [righteousness](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/righteousness)" (Matthew 3:13-16)

It would not be necessary for the Holy God to go through a ceremony of cleansing to fulfil righteousness to himself. Instead with this ceremony, Jesus was dedicated for God's special purpose which implies [Jesus is distinct from God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/distinct) as God Himself publicly proclaimed:

> "This is [My beloved Son](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-god) with whom I am well pleased." -- Matthew 3:17; Luke 3:21

### Jesus' purpose

If Jesus was God, he would have recruited disciples for his own benefit, but instead [God sent Jesus](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/serve-god) (Galatians 4:4-5) to preach the good news of the kingdom of God (Luke 4:42-44). 

Jesus identified himself as "[the way](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/mediator)... to [the Father](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/father)" (John 14:6; 1 Timothy 2:5) which implies there is a bigger [God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god) (1 Corinthians 3:23; 11:3; 15:28).

God had given up His ***only*** and ***beloved*** Son, and God had to watch him suffer and die at the crucifixion to save a world of sinful people (John 3:16-17)! Jesus, who was no demigod, must have really suffered like a mortal human. This explains why Jesus was distressed at the Garden of Gethsemane (Matthew 26; Mark 14; Luke 22). This is why Jesus has the right, as a human who understand our experiences, to judge us (John 5:26-27).

### Jesus temptation

**God cannot be tempted** (James 1:13), yet Jesus was tempted (Hebrews 4:15). 

Matthew 4:1-10 and Luke 4:1-12 describes how [the devil tempted Jesus](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-god/temptations).

In short the devil was basically saying:
1. That God is a bad God, because God "failed" to provide bread to Jesus.
2. Then the devil offered an alternative plan to Jesus: authority, glory, and deliverance of all the kingdoms in exchange for worshipping the devil instead of God. When Jesus declined, 
3. the devil tried to make Jesus doubt in God's protection.

None of these temptations would make any sense if Jesus was God. Yet the devil did not make a mistake, but knew exactly who God was (James 2:19).

If Jesus was God:
* Jesus would have led the Spirit, instead of the Spirit leading Jesus (Matthew 4:1; Luke 4:1).
* The devil would have asked Jesus to prove that he is God, instead the devil asked to only prove that he is the Son (Luke 4:3,9).
* Jesus would have quoted the wrong scripture which are only applicable to man (Luke 4:4 quoting Deuteronomy 8:3).
* The devil would have quoted the wrong scripture (Matthew 4:5-7 & Luke 4:9-11 quoting Psalm 91:11-12) and Jesus would have no need to respond.
* The devil's offer for kingdoms (Matthew 4:9; Luke 4:5-6) would not have been a temptation at all, because God already owns everything (Psalm 24:1).
* Jesus would have referred to himself as God, but instead he refers to [God as Someone distinct](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/distinct)** (Matthew 4:6-7,10; Luke 4:12).

### Jesus inheritance

If Jesus was God Himself, he would own everything, yet it was prophesied that Jesus would inherit from God (Psalm 2:7-11). This understanding is also confirmed by Paul (Romans 8:17).

> The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs — heirs of God and **fellow heirs with Christ**, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him. -- Romans 8:17 (ESV)

## Relating to Jesus

### Worship

Many people confuse:

| Term                                                      | Meaning                                                                                   | Can be given to a man? |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| [praise](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/praise)                                     | Express gratitude or honour to someone, often in the form of music or public declarations | yes                    |
| [paying obeisance](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/worship#paying-obeisance-worship) | Humbling oneself to pay respect to a very important person, like bowing or kneeling       | yes                    |
| [sacrificial worship](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/worship#sacrificial-worship)   | Serving God with a sacrifice (valuable gift)                                              | no                     |

All of the above are often referred to as ["worship"](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/worship) by modern English speakers which is the root cause of confusion and debates regarding the topic why the disciples 'worshipped' Jesus. 

The disciples were [paying obeisance](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/worship#paying-obeisance-worship) to Jesus as their king. This is indicated by their actions, but often translated described as "worship" in the Greek source text. The distinction is that this kind of worship is "worship" only without "serving" a sacrifice.

There are [no scripture](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/as-god/worship) of anyone that has "worship and serve" (with a sacrifice) Jesus like they did to God as it was in the case of Deuteronomy 8:19-20; Luke 4:8; Exodus 23:25 and so forth. Instead, Jesus rebuked this kind of worship to anyone other than God (Luke 4:8).

### Prayers

Neither Jesus nor any of the apostles ever instructed anyone to pray to Jesus. Instead, [prayers have always been directed to God the Father](https://eternal.family.net.za/life/prayer) (Ezra 9:5-6; Matthew 6:9-13; Luke 11:1-2; Philippians 4:6-7; 1 Timothy 2:1-4).

Yet, we have the examples of Stephen, Paul and John who [communicated with Jesus after his ascension](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/as-god/prayer), but in all these instance they were directly speaking to Jesus in a vision like people do when they speak to angels.

#### Jesus' name

Praying or acting "in the name of Jesus" is no way of addressing Jesus. In modern English "name" means designation, but [the original Greek phrase](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/name) means to act in the authority of someone more important. For example, when the Roman officials taxed the Jews in the name of Caesar, it means they have his permission to act as delegates to do their job. Likewise, when Jesus' disciples act or pray in the name of Jesus, it means they are requesting God to do something so that they can act with the permission of Jesus. 

## What This Means for You

As you reflect on this evidence, consider: **How does your understanding of Jesus's nature affect your faith?**

If Jesus is God Himself, you worship a deity who experienced human limitations firsthand: Who knows hunger, pain, temptation, and even the *feeling of separation* from divinity. Your salvation rests on God's willingness to humble Himself and take human form to rescue His creation.

If Jesus is the Son of God (fully human but uniquely empowered by the Father), you follow a man who perfectly represented God and set an achievable standard for holiness. Your salvation rests on God's love being so great that He gave His only beloved son, watching him suffer and die to redeem the world (John 3:16).

Both perspectives magnify God's love, though in different ways. What matters most is not that you perfectly comprehend the metaphysics of Christ's nature, but that you trust in His work and follow His teachings. Remember, Jesus converted people who simply believed he was the Christ, the son of God (John 20:31). It was not necessary for people to understand the Trinity.

**Don't rely solely on creeds, traditions, or even this article.** Examine the Scriptures yourself. Pray for wisdom (James 1:5). Consider the evidence with an open heart, even if it challenges what you've always believed. The truth is not afraid of investigation.

Ask yourself:
- Does your view of Jesus draw you closer to God or create theological confusion?
- Does it help you follow Jesus's example, or make it an impossible task?
- Does it align with the full counsel of Scripture, or only selected verses?

Ultimately, your relationship with God through Christ matters more than winning a theological debate. Whether you conclude Jesus is "God the Son" or "the Son of God", let your understanding lead you to worship God in spirit and truth (John 4:23-24) and to love others as the Christ set the example.
