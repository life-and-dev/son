# The Son as God

I've studied church history and discovered something troubling. Throughout the centuries, believers were persecuted as heretics for calling Jesus anything less than God Almighty. The Arian controversy in the fourth century saw thousands condemned for questioning whether the Son possessed the exact same nature as the Father. The Inquisition later targeted anyone who dared to make distinctions between the Father and the Son.

## The Flexible Meaning of "God"

The word ["God" has many different meanings](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/god). Consider that [human kings and heroes were often also called "gods" by both Hebrew and Greek speakers](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/god). Given this flexibility in ancient usage, it becomes easier to understand why "the Son" could technically also be considered ***a*** god.

## What Scripture Affirms About the Son

The majority of Christians agree that Jesus:

* [Will judge us or forgive our sin](https://eternal.family.net.za/son/essence/as-god/forgiveness) (Matthew 10:32-33; John 5:22; 1 John 2:1; Mark 2:10)
* [Will return with an army of angels](https://eternal.family.net.za/son/essence/as-god/return) (Matthew 16:27-28; Revelation 22:1-5)
* Will rule over our world (Matthew 28:18; Psalm 2:8-12; Isaiah 42:1-4; Hebrews 2:7-8; Philippians 2:10-11)
* [Has authority to heal](https://eternal.family.net.za/son/essence/as-god/miracles) (John 4:46-54, 5:8-9)
* [Has authority over death](https://eternal.family.net.za/son/essence/as-god/resurrected) (John 5:21; Revelation 1:17-18)
* Looks after his people (John 10:14)
* [Is eternal](https://eternal.family.net.za/son/essence/as-god/eternal) (Revelation 1:17-18)

## The Theological Distinction

However, when the majority of Christians, Muslims and Jews mention "God", they mean the Almighty God. They do not acknowledge any divine spirits, angels or powerful humans as gods. This creates a fundamental difference between the flexible ancient usage and modern theological language.

## The Missing Phrase

You will never find the phrase "the Son **as** God" in the Bible. What you will find is "the Son **of** God," which has a completely different meaning.

"The Son of God" indicates relationship and origin. It describes Jesus's unique connection to the Father. This phrase appears throughout Scripture (Matthew 4:3; Mark 1:1; John 1:34; Romans 1:4; and dozens of other passages).

"The Son as God," by contrast, claims Jesus is God himself, not merely related to God. This phrase was invented by theologians to support [the Trinity doctrine](/trinity.md), but you will never find it in Scripture.

## Where Does This Leave You?

So what should you do with this information? According to modern English standards and monotheistic principles, you should avoid calling anything less than God Almighty by the title "god." Here's why this matters.

Using "god" for beings other than the Almighty creates serious confusion. When you speak with most Muslims or Jews, they will assume you worship multiple gods. Even Trinitarian Christians do not call individual members of the Trinity "gods".

Modern English usage has moved away from the flexible ancient terminology. Today, capitalizing "God" signals the one supreme being. Using lowercase "god" or calling multiple beings "God" undermines the clarity that monotheistic faiths require. This isn't just about grammar. It's about maintaining truthful communication in a world where precision matters.

Reserve the title "God" for the Almighty alone. Affirm everything Scripture says about Jesus's authority, power, and eternal nature without importing confusing terminology. You can honor the Son fully while still preserving the distinction that monotheism demands.
