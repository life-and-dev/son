# The Son of God

I grew up hearing people say "Jesus is God." But when I actually read the Bible, I noticed Jesus never claimed to be the Son *as* God. Instead, he consistently said he is the Son **of** God. That small word, "of", changed everything for me. Was I missing something fundamental about who Jesus really is? Let me share what I discovered.

Jesus being the Son **of** God means:

* [The Son is distinct from the Father](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/distinct)
* [The Father approves the Son](#gods-own-declaration)
* [The Son acts under the Father's authority](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-god/temptations)
* [The Son inherits the Father's kingdom](#jesus-sinlessness--legal-position-as-the-worthy-heir)

## What "Son of God" Does NOT Mean

The Bible never uses the phrases "God the Son" or "the Son **as** God." This distinction is critical. Many [Trinitarians](trinity.md) conflate "Son **of** God" with "God the Son," but these are fundamentally different concepts.

"The Son of God" does not mean that Jesus was:
- God Himself in human form
- A mode or manifestation of God
- A member of a co-equal "Godhead"
- A reincarnated deity, demi-god, or angel
- God's avatar or puppet

Instead, the title "Son **of** God" refers to Jesus' **legal position** with God as His "beloved Son with whom He is well pleased" and the only legitimate heir appointed to rule. This is a Father-Son relationship, not a deity claim.

## Translation

Some bible translations like the KJV state that Jesus is the "only begotten Son of the Father":

> I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, **Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee**. -- Psalm 2:7 (KJV); Acts 13:33; Hebrews 1:5, 5:5

> And [the word](word.md) was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of **the only begotten of the Father**) full of grace and truth. -- John 1:14 (KJV)
 
> The only **begotten** son, who is in the bosom of the Father, [He has declared him](son-as-god/john-1-18.md). -- John 1:18 (NKJV)

> In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that **God sent his only begotten Son** into the world, that we might live through him. -- 1 John 4:9 (KJV)

The Greek word translated as "only begotten" is:

|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|

| Part of Speech    | Adjective                                                   |

| Definition        | only begotten                                               |

The literal translation seems to mean that Jesus was the only Son that was ever *born* to God. However, in John 3 we read that God actually has many "reborned sons".

## Reborned sons

> There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews: 
> 
> The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, "Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him."  
> Jesus answered and said unto him, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except **a man be [born](https://biblehub.com/greek/1080.htm) again**, he cannot see the kingdom of God."  
> Nicodemus saith unto him, "How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?"  
> Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except **a man be born of water and of the spirit**, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. 
> * That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and 
> * that which is born of the spirit is spirit.
> Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the spirit."  
> Nicodemus answered and said unto him, "How can these things be?"  
> Jesus answered and said unto him, "Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?"
> 
> And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even [the Son of man](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-man) which is in heaven. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must [the Son of man](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-man) be lifted up: That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.  For God so loved the world, that He gave His **only begotten Son**, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not **His Son** into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in [the name](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/name) of **the only begotten Son of God**.
> 
> -- John 3:1-18 (KJV)

Jesus was not referring to the physical birth of a person as he corrected Nicodemus. Instead, Jesus refers to the ["birth of water"](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/saved/baptize) and ["birth of the spirit"](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/saved/spirit) which modern Christians call ["baptism"](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/saved/baptize).

Therefore, some would argue that "the only begotten Son of God" means "the only baptized Son of God", because the purpose of baptism is to *reborn* the spirit and Jesus himself was baptized. 

The context here is that Jesus was dealing with condemnation and everlasting life. John did not record the details of the entire conversation but concluded that it is necessary that we should believe that God sent His "only begotten Son" to save us, so that we ["should not perish, but have everlasting life"](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/death). It was very important for John to highlight multiple times in his book that Jesus was "the only begotten Son of God".

## The only Son of God

The word "only" which came from the Greek word "monos", means "alone". This means "the only begotten Son of God" had to be a unique attribute to Jesus which sets him apart from every other person.

* Jesus was not the only (alone) one who was baptized. John the Baptist had baptize many people before Jesus, so it does not make sense to say Jesus is *"the only baptized Son of God"*. 
* Jesus was not the only "son of God", because there were many other ["sons of God"](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/sons) named in the Old Testament before Jesus was born. 

Anyone can be adopted into "sonship" by another Father. If this was John's intention it would have been sufficient to write "Jesus was *a* Son of God" (like many other), but that is not what he wrote.

If one study the root of the Greek word "monogenés":

> monogenḗs (from 3411 /misthōtós, "one-and-only" and 1085 /génos, "offspring, stock") -- [HELP Word-studies](https://biblehub.com/greek/3439.htm)

|             | [NAS Exhaustive Concordance](https://biblehub.com/greek/3439.htm)                                                      |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Word origin | from [monos](https://biblehub.com/greek/3441.htm) (alone) and [genos](https://biblehub.com/greek/1085.htm) (offspring) |
| Definition  | only begotten                                                                                                          |

Which literally means Jesus was "the only ***offspring*** Son of God" where all other sons were "adopted" by God. This is why Jesus was considered "**the** Son of God" and not just *a* son of God. For example the same language is used in Hebrews:

> By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up **his only begotten son**. -- Hebrews 11:17 (KJV)

Isaac was not Abraham's only biological son. At that time Abraham already had another elder son, called Ishmael (Genesis 16:11). However, Ismael was rejected by the family. In this context it meant Isaac was the only heir of Abraham. If this was the understanding of the Greek word "monogenḗs", then it could mean that Jesus was the only son that was worthy to God.

This could also explain why it was such a revelation for many people to discover this unique position of Jesus. But the most powerful witness to Jesus' sonship didn't come from theological analysis. It came from God the Father Himself.

## God's Own Declaration

God Himself announced that Jesus is His Son:

> And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending [like a dove](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/tales/dove) and coming to rest on him; and behold, a voice from heaven said,
>
> ***“This is My beloved Son***, with whom I am well pleased.”***
>
> -- Matthew 3:16-17 (ESV); Mark 1:9-11; Luke 3:21; John 1:51

And at Jesus transfiguration God also announced:

> And a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud, ***“This is my beloved Son; listen to him.”*** -- Mark 9:7 (ESV)

Peter also testifies as an eyewitness:

> For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but **we were eyewitnesses** of his majesty. For when he received honor and glory from God the Father, and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory, ***"This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased***," **we ourselves heard this very voice borne from heaven**, for **we were with him** on the holy mountain. -- 2 Peter 1:16-18 (ESV)

### Trinitarian Objection Refuted

[Trinitarians](trinity.md) explain these scriptures to mean that [the Son *as* God](son-as-god.md) was telling the world that He loves Himself. However, this interpretation has logical and biblical problems:

* The people heard another voice from heaven saying this, while Jesus was standing in their presence. 
    * If the voice was coming from a different God while Jesus was in their presence, it logically means Jesus is not that God and that God is not Jesus.
    * God is not suffering from NPD (Narcissistic Personality Disorder), therefore it does not make sense that God had to publicly announce that He loves Himself.
* The voice could have said to the disciples: *"This is a member of the Godhead, listen to him"*, or *"This is your new God, listen to him"*, or *"This is My human body / avatar / image, listen to it"*, but instead God said *"This is My beloved **son**"* which implies that Jesus is not God Himself, because nature demonstrates that no father can be his own son.

## Jesus' Own Testimony

Jesus himself consistently affirmed this Father-Son relationship. He referred to himself as the "Son **of** God" (John 10:36) and prayed publicly to demonstrate this distinction:

> And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, “[Father](https://ofgod.info), I thank You that You have heard me. I knew that You always hear me, but I said this **on account of the people standing around, that they may believe that You sent me**.” -- John 11:41-42 (ESV)

If Jesus prayed to himself as a "Father" Who "always hear" him (an action that happens between two [distinct](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/distinct) parties), and Jesus prayed "on account of the people standing around that they may believe", then he would have totally confused everyone if he really was God the Father especially if he indicates that this "Father" had "sent" him (another [distinct](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/distinct) action).

Another example:

> When Jesus had spoken these words, he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, “[Father](https://ofgod.info), the hour has come; **glorify your Son** that the Son may glorify you, since you have given him authority over all flesh, to give eternal life to all whom you have given him. And this is eternal life, **that they know you, the only true God**, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. I glorified you on earth, having accomplished the work that you gave me to do. And now, Father, **glorify me** in your own presence with the glory that I had with you before the world existed. -- John 17:1-5 (ESV)

Peter also testified that God is Jesus' Father:

> Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples,
>
> “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?”  
> And they said, “Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”  
> He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?”  
> Simon Peter replied, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”  
> And Jesus answered him, “Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, **but my Father** who is in heaven.
>
> -- Matthew 16:13-17 (ESV)

Peter could have said: *"You are God"*, but he said *"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God"*. Jesus did not correct Peter, but instead praised him because *"his Father"* revealed this information such that Peter continued teaching his disciples this way:

> The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified His son Jesus -- Acts 3:13 (KJV)

> For of a truth against **thy holy child** Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together, for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done. And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word, by stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of **thy holy child** Jesus. -- Acts 4:27-30 (KJV)

[(Some translations translate "child" as "servant".)](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/serve-god#jesus-is-called-gods-servant)

Paul testifies that God is Jesus' Father:

> Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning **His Son**, who was descended from David according to the flesh and was **declared to be the Son of God in power** according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations, including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ -- Romans 1:1-6 (NKJV)

and

> But when the fullness of the time had come, **God sent forth His Son**, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, that [we might receive the adoption as sons](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/sons-of-god). -- Galatians 4:4-5 (NKJV)

and

> Blessed be the **God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ**, Who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places... -- Ephesians 1:3 (ESV)

and

> Therefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints, do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers:
>
> that **[the God of our Lord Jesus Christ](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god), the Father of glory**, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, the eyes of your understanding being enlightened.
>
> -- Ephesians 1:15-18 (NKJV)

## Who Identified Jesus as the Son of God

Beyond God's own declaration and Jesus' own testimony, many others recognized Jesus' unique position as the Son of God.

### Disciples

#### John

> And I have seen and have borne witness that this *(Jesus)* is **the Son of God**. -- John 1:34 (ESV)

> Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book; but these are written so that you may believe that **Jesus is [the Christ](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/christ), the Son of God**, and that by believing you may have life in his name. -- John 20:30-31 (ESV)

#### Mark

> The beginning of the gospel of Jesus [Christ](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/christ), **the Son of God**. -- Mark 1:1 (ESV)

#### Martha

> She said to him *(Jesus)*, "Yes, Lord; I believe that you are [the Christ](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/christ), **the Son of God**, who is coming into the world." -- John 11:27 (ESV)

#### Paul

> And immediately he *(Paul)* proclaimed Jesus in the synagogues, saying, "He is **the Son of God**." -- Acts 9:20 (NKJV)

> For **the Son of God, Jesus [Christ](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/christ)**, whom we proclaimed among you... -- 2 Corinthians 1:19 (NKJV)

#### Author of Hebrews

> Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, **Jesus, the Son of God**, let us hold fast our confession. -- Hebrews 4:14 (NKJV)

### Non-disciples

#### Gabriel

> And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name **Jesus**. He will be great and will be called **the Son** of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end."
> And Mary said to the angel, "How will this be, since I am a virgin?"
> And the angel answered her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy — **the Son of God**.
>
> -- Luke 1:31-35 (ESV)

#### Nathanael

> Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, "We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
> And Nathanael said unto him, "Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?"
> Philip saith unto him, "Come and see."
>
> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!"  Nathanael saith unto him, "Whence knowest thou me?"
> Jesus answered and said unto him, "Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee."
> Nathanael answered and saith unto him, "**Rabbi**, thou art **the Son of God**; thou art [the King of Israel](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/as-god/lord).
> Jesus answered and said unto him, "Because I said unto thee, 'I saw thee under the fig tree', believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these."
> And he saith unto him, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon [the Son of man](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-man).
>
> -- John 1:45-51 (KJV)

#### The centurion

> When the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe and said, ***"Truly this was the Son of God!"*** -- Matthew 27:54 (NKJV)

#### Demons and Evil Spirits

Even Jesus' enemies in the spiritual realm — beings who existed in God's presence and knew spiritual truth firsthand — recognized His identity as the Son of God. Unlike humans who might be deceived, demons had no choice but to acknowledge reality:

> And whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, **"You are the Son of God."** -- Mark 3:11 (ESV)

> And behold, they cried out, "What have you to do with us, **O Son of God**? Have you come here to torment us before the time?" -- Matthew 8:29 (ESV)

> And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit. And he cried out, "What have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are — **the Holy One of God**." -- Mark 1:23-24 (ESV)

Notice what demons never said. They never addressed Jesus as:
- "God Himself"
- "God the Son"
- "The second person of the Trinity"
- "Our Creator"

Instead, they consistently used relational titles that distinguished Jesus from the Father:
- "**Son of God**" — acknowledging His relationship to the Father
- "**Holy One of God**" — recognizing His unique position with God
- "Have you come... **before the time**?" — showing they knew He acted under the Father's authority and timeline

If Jesus were God Himself, why would demons — who existed in the spiritual realm before the foundation of the world (Job 38:7) and knew the truth about God's nature — consistently use the title "Son of God" rather than simply "God"? Their involuntary confessions reveal what [Trinitarians](/bible/doctrines/trinitarian) often miss: Jesus' authority came **from** the Father, not **as** the Father.

#### The devil

The devil's temptation follows the same pattern. He never requested Jesus to prove "you are God," but instead challenged Jesus to prove He is "the Son of God":

> The devil said to him, "If you are **the Son of God**, command ..."
> And he *(the devil)* took him *(Jesus)* to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, "If you are **the Son of God**, throw yourself down from here...
>
> -- Luke 4:3,9 (ESV)

## Jesus' Sinlessness & Legal Position as the Worthy Heir

What made Jesus "*the* Son of God" rather than just another "son of God"? The answer lies in His sinlessness, which qualified Him as the **worthy heir** of all things.

### Scripture Declares Jesus Was Without Sin

The Bible consistently affirms that Jesus lived a completely sinless life:

**Direct Statements:**

> For our sake he made him to be sin **who knew no sin**, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. -- 2 Corinthians 5:21 (ESV)

> For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, **yet without sin**. -- Hebrews 4:15 (ESV)

> **He committed no sin**, neither was deceit found in his mouth. -- 1 Peter 2:22 (ESV)

> You know that he appeared in order to take away sins, and **in him there is no sin**. -- 1 John 3:5 (ESV)

**Character Descriptions:**

> For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest, **holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners**, and exalted above the heavens. -- Hebrews 7:26 (ESV)

> And they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death, although **he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth**. -- Isaiah 53:9 (ESV)

**Jesus' Own Challenge:**

> **Which one of you convicts me of sin?** If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me? -- John 8:46 (ESV)

**Sacrificial Symbolism:**

> knowing that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold, but with **the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot**. -- 1 Peter 1:18-19 (ESV)

> how much more will the blood of Christ, **who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God**, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God. -- Hebrews 9:14 (ESV)

### Sinlessness Qualified Jesus as THE Heir and Lord

The Bible teaches that **only the righteous can inherit God's kingdom**:

> Or do you not know that **the unrighteous will not inherit** [the kingdom of God](https://kingdom.ofgod.info)? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. -- 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 (ESV)

> Now the works of the flesh are evident... I warn you, as I warned you before, that **those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God**. -- Galatians 5:19-21 (ESV)

Jesus' sinlessness qualified Him to inherit not merely as a beneficiary, but as **THE heir who rules**. He is appointed **Lord** over the kingdom:

> ...that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that **Jesus Christ is Lord**, to the glory of God the Father. -- Philippians 2:10-11 (ESV)

> Jesus Christ... the **ruler of kings on earth**... made us a **kingdom**, priests to his God and Father... -- Revelation 1:5-6 (ESV)

> For all things are yours... and you are Christ's, and **Christ is God's**. -- 1 Corinthians 3:21-23 (ESV)

If Jesus was God Himself, He would already own everything. Yet Scripture prophesied that Jesus would **inherit** from God (Psalm 2:7-11). This proves Jesus is distinct from God the Father.

### Believers as Fellow Heirs Through Adoption

Believers, by contrast, do not inherit God's kingdom because of personal sinlessness. We were once among the unrighteous who could not inherit (1 Corinthians 6:9-10). But through faith in Christ, we are "washed, sanctified, justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Corinthians 6:11) and **adopted as sons**:

> For **all** who are led by [the Spirit of God](trinity/holy-spirit.md) are **sons of God**. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom **we** cry, "Abba! Father!" The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that **we are children of God**, and if children, then heirs — **heirs of God** and **fellow heirs with Christ**, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him. -- Romans 8:14-17 (ESV)

Notice the distinction: We are **fellow heirs WITH Christ**, not independent heirs. We inherit as **participants** in the kingdom under Christ's lordship, not as lords ourselves.

Jesus' sinlessness established His **legal position** as "*the* Son of God" — not because He was God incarnate, but because He was the only one **worthy to be THE heir and Lord**.

## But Who Was Jesus' Biological Father?

From a scientific perspective, very little information is given about how Jesus came to exist in Mary's womb. The biblical account states:

> And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus...
> And Mary said to the angel, "How will this be, since I am a virgin?"
> And the angel answered her, "**The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you**; therefore the child to be born will be called holy — the Son of God.
>
> -- Luke 1:31-35 (ESV)

Mary had no husband, and the Holy Spirit impregnated her. This technically makes [the Holy Spirit](trinity/holy-spirit.md) Jesus' biological Father. This is a problem for [Trinitarians](trinity.md) who belief the Holy Spirit is a distinct person from "the Father".

### Adam: A Precedent for Divine Sonship

Interestingly, Luke's genealogy calls Adam "the son of God":

> ...the son of Enos, the son of Seth, **the son of Adam, the son of God**. -- Luke 3:38 (ESV)

When God formed Adam from the dust of the earth (Genesis 2:7), Adam had no biological parents. Yet in ancient biblical language, someone created from dust could be called a "son of God." If this is the case, then Jesus — created in the womb of a woman — could also technically be called a "son of God."

However, Jesus was not just **a** son of God. He was ***the*** Son of God.

### Paul's Adam-Jesus Comparison

The Apostle Paul draws a deliberate comparison between Adam and Jesus, both considered "sons of God":

> For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive. -- 1 Corinthians 15:22 (ESV)

> Thus it is written, "The first man Adam became a living being"; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit. -- 1 Corinthians 15:45 (ESV)

### Incarnation Is Not a Biblical Concept

The doctrine of incarnation — that God transformed Himself into human form or "took on flesh" — is not found in Scripture. The Bible never mentions:

- God shape-shifting or changing forms
- God becoming a different being
- God "taking on" human nature through transformation
- Any deity becoming human through metamorphosis

From a logical perspective, incarnation theology introduces complexity that may not be necessary. It is simpler to accept that God, as the Creator, can create anything, anywhere, anytime — even a seed in a woman's womb — than to propose that God transformed Himself into a different form of being.

God did not need to "incarnate" or "become" Jesus. He **created** Jesus in Mary's womb, just as He created Adam from dust. The difference is not the method of creation, but the **legal position** of the created being.

Some argue that "begotten" implies eternal generation, distinguishing Jesus from created beings. However, Psalm 2:7 states, "this day have I begotten thee," placing the begetting at a specific point in time, not eternity past. Similarly, Acts 13:33 and Hebrews 5:5 cite this verse in reference to Jesus' resurrection and appointment as High Priest. "Begotten" refers to Jesus' unique origin from God through the Holy Spirit and His appointment to the position of Son, not an eternal, timeless process.

### The Promised "Seed of the Woman"

God's first messianic prophecy points to this truth:

> I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between **your offspring and her offspring**; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel. -- Genesis 3:15 (ESV)

Notice the unusual wording: "**the seed of the woman**" — not the seed of a man. In ancient times, seed typically referred to the father's contribution. Yet this prophecy emphasizes the woman's offspring.

This could imply that the Christ would be formed from a woman's contribution without a man's seed, foreshadowing the virgin birth. However, we must be cautious about reading modern biology into ancient prophecy. The ancient Hebrews did not understand reproduction as we do today. What we can say with certainty is that the prophecy distinguished the Messiah's origin as unique — from the woman, defeating the serpent — which was fulfilled in Jesus' virgin birth through the Holy Spirit.

### God as Creator, Not Incarnator

The biblical account presents God as **Creator**, not as one who incarnates:

- Adam: Created from dust → called "son of God"
- Jesus: Created in Mary's womb → called "**the** Son of God"
- Holy Spirit impregnated Mary → God is the biological Father
- Jesus' sinlessness → establishes legal position as THE worthy heir and Lord

The concept of incarnation introduces unnecessary complexity. It is simpler and more consistent with Scripture to understand that God **created** Jesus through the Holy Spirit, making Him the biological Son of God and, through His sinlessness, **THE heir appointed to rule** over all things.

## Your Response

You have seen the evidence. God Himself declared at Jesus' baptism and transfiguration, "This is My beloved Son." Jesus prayed to His Father publicly, demonstrating they are distinct beings. Demons who knew spiritual truth firsthand called Him "Son of God," never "God Himself." The apostles testified consistently that Jesus is the Son **of** God, not "God the Son."

The question before you is not academic. It is personal. For centuries, church tradition has taught the [Trinity](trinity.md) doctrine. Councils formulated creeds to explain this concept. But did these creeds come from Scripture itself, or from human attempts to systematize theology?

You cannot claim to follow Scripture alone while accepting doctrines that Scripture never teaches. If the phrase "God the Son" appears nowhere in your Bible, why do you confess it? If Jesus consistently called God His Father and prayed to Him as a distinct being, why do you insist they are the same?

This is not merely about theology. This is about truth. This is about whom you worship and how you understand the gospel. If Jesus is "the Son of God" because of His legal position as THE heir appointed by God to rule, then salvation comes through believing in the one whom the Father sent. If Jesus is "God the Son" who incarnated, we must ask: Does this teaching come from the Bible, or from later theological development? 

Instead of calling Jesus, "God the Son", the apostle John wrote his gospel "so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son **of** God, and that by believing you may have life in his name" (John 20:31).

**Will you believe what the Bible actually says? Or will you continue to accept what men have told you it means?**
