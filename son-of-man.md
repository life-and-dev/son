# The Son of Man

I've encountered countless discussions where Christians assume that calling Jesus "the Son of Man" means God came to earth as a man. This interpretation seems straightforward at first. After all, if Jesus is God, and Jesus calls himself "the Son of Man", then naturally God must have become a man. But then the Jews may point out:

> "**God is not a man**, that He should lie, **nor a son of man**, that He should repent. — Numbers 23:19 (NKJV)

What if the title "Son of Man" actually points to something completely different? What if we've been missing the deeper meaning all along?

In Genesis the same Hebrew name that is often translated as ["Adam" also means "man"](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/120.htm).

> So God created **man** in his own image... — Genesis 1:27 (ESV)

and

> The LORD God formed **the man** of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and **the man** became a living creature. And the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he put **the man** whom he had formed. — Genesis 2:7-8 (ESV)

and

> The LORD God took **the man** and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.
>
> And the LORD God commanded **the man**, saying, “You may surely eat of every tree of the garden, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.”  
> Then the LORD God said, “It is not good that **the man** should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.”
>
> Now out of the ground the LORD God had formed every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens and brought them to **the man** to see what he would call them. And whatever **the man** called every living creature, that was its name. **The man** gave names to all livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast of the field. But for *Adam* ([Man](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/120.htm)) there was not found a helper fit for him. So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon **the man**, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh. And the rib that the LORD God had taken from **the man** he made into a woman and brought her to **the man**.
>
> Then **the man** said, “This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of **Man**.”
>
> — Genesis 2:15-23 (ESV)

Then God gave [His Word](word.md) to Eve:

> I *(God)* will put enmity between you *(the devil)* and the woman *(Eve)*, and between your offspring and **her offspring**;  
> He *(Jesus)* shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.”
>
> — Genesis 3:15 (ESV, with interpretive notes added for clarity)

The text shows that God did not tell Eve that He Himself would personally come and bruise the devil. Instead, He promised that Eve's offspring would do that.

When Jesus asked the question:

> "Who do people say that **the Son of Man** is?" — Matthew 16:13 (ESV)

The Jews did not answer *"God as a man"*, but instead...

> they said, “Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.” — Matthew 16:14 (ESV)

Eve was the wife of "Man". So when Jesus says he is the "son of Man" this indicates he is that promised "offspring" of "Man" that will bruise the head of the "snake".

## The authority of the Son of Man

Every time Jesus refers to himself as "the Son of Man", he uses it in the context of his God given authority or purpose. Just to list a few examples:

> But that you may know that the Son of Man **has authority on earth to forgive sins** — Matthew 9:6 (ESV)

> For the Son of Man **is lord of the Sabbath** — Matthew 12:8 (ESV)

> For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, **so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth**. — Matthew 12:40 (ESV)

> For the Son of Man **is going to come with his angels** in the glory of his Father... — Matthew 16:27 (ESV)

> ... the Son of Man **coming in his kingdom** — Matthew 16:28 (ESV)

> And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, “Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man **is raised from the dead**.” — Matthew 17:9 (ESV)

> See, we are going up to Jerusalem. And the Son of Man **will be delivered over to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death**...even as the Son of Man **came not to be served but to serve**, and to give his life as a ransom for many — Matthew 20:18,28 (ESV)

> For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man... **then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man**, — Matthew 24:27,30 (ESV)

> Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man **is coming** at an hour you do not expect. — Matthew 24:44 (ESV)

... and so forth.

## Jesus compared to Adam

> For as by a man *(Adam)* came death, by **a man** *(Jesus)* has come also the resurrection of the dead.
>
>...
>
> Thus it is written, “The first man Adam **became a living being**”; the last Adam **became a life-giving spirit**. But it is not the spiritual that is first but the natural, and then the spiritual.
>
> **The first man** was from the earth, a man of dust; **the second man** is from heaven. As was **the man of dust**, so also are those who are of the dust, and as is **the man of heaven**, so also are those who are of heaven. Just as we have borne the image of **the man of dust**, we shall also bear the image of **the man of heaven**.
-- 1 Corinthians 15:21,45-49 (ESV)

Paul compares Jesus to Adam, using parallel descriptions for both: "the man of dust" and "the man of heaven". This comparison makes sense if Jesus is the promised human offspring from Genesis.

Although he also states that both Adam and Jesus were different from us:

> Adam, who was a type of the one who was to come. — Romans 5:14 (ESV)

Adam was a pattern or foreshadowing of Jesus. Both were unique humans with special origins and purposes.

## The True Meaning of "the Son of Man"

Now that we've seen the Genesis promise and how Jesus used the title "the Son of Man" to describe his mission, let's examine what the scriptures reveal about Jesus's identity and his relationship to God. These passages help us understand why "the Son of Man" identifies Jesus as the promised offspring, not as God coming to earth as a man.

### Jesus's Statements About Himself

> So He said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good but One, that is, God. — Matthew 19:17 (NKJV)

and

> So Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing...
>
> How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from **the only** God? Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father.
>
> — John 5:19,44-45 (ESV)

and

> Jesus answered, “I do not have a demon, but **I honor my Father**, and you dishonor me. Yet **I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it, and He is the judge**. — John 8:49-50 (ESV)

and

> Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that **He is your God.** — John 8:54 (KJV)

and

> Jesus spoke these words, lifted up His eyes to heaven, and said: "Father, the hour has come. Glorify Your Son, that Your Son also may glorify You, as You have given him authority over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as You have given him. And this is eternal life, that they may know You, **the only true God**, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent. — John 17:1-3 (NKJV)

In these statements, Jesus consistently distinguished himself from God the Father, referring to the Father as "the only God" and "the only true God." These declarations align with Jesus being the promised offspring, the Son of Man, rather than God himself coming to earth.

### Jesus's Relationship with the Father

Jesus explicitly called God "my God" and consistently demonstrated dependence on the Father through prayer and worship:

> Jesus said to her, "Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brothers and say to them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to ***my God*** and your God.'" — John 20:17 (ESV)

Jesus regularly prayed to his Father:

> And he *(Jesus)* went a little further, and **fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father**, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt...
> 
> He *(Jesus)* went away again the second time, and **prayed, saying, O my Father**, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done...
> 
> Thinkest thou that I cannot now **pray to my Father**, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?
> 
> — Matthew 26:39,42,53 (KJV)

> And it came to pass in those days, that he *(Jesus)* went out into a mountain to pray, and **continued all night in prayer to God**. — Luke 6:12

> And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, "**Father**, I thank you that you have heard me." — John 11:41 (ESV)

> When Jesus had spoken these words, he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, "**Father**, the hour has come..." — John 17:1 (ESV)

### The Apostles' Understanding

The apostles consistently affirmed that [God the Father](https://ofgod.info) is Jesus Christ's [God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god).

**Paul** repeatedly referred to God as the Father of Jesus Christ:

> Blessed be **the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ**, Who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places... — Ephesians 1:3 (ESV)

and

> Therefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints, do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers:
>
> that **the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory**, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, the eyes of your understanding being enlightened.
>
> — Ephesians 1:15-18 (NKJV)

and

> May the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to live in such harmony with one another, in accord with Christ Jesus, that together you may with one voice glorify **the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ**. — Romans 15:5-6 (ESV)

and

> Blessed be **the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ**, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. — 2 Corinthians 1:3-4 (ESV)

and

> **The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ**, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not. — 2 Corinthians 11:31 (KJV)

**Peter** declared Jesus to be God's servant and affirmed God as the Father of Jesus:

> The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified **His servant Jesus**, whom you delivered over and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release him. — Acts 3:13 (ESV)

and

> Blessed be **the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ**, who according to His abundant mercy has begotten us again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that does not fade away, reserved in heaven for you, who are kept by the power of God through faith for salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. — 1 Peter 1:3-5 (NKJV)

**John** consistently portrayed Jesus as having a God:

> Grace to you and peace from Him who is and Who was and Who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before His throne, and **from Jesus Christ the faithful witness**, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth. To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood and made us a kingdom, priests **to his God and Father**, to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. — Revelation 1:4-6 (ESV)

Jesus also reveals:

> When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. But he laid his right hand on me, saying, "Fear not, I am the first and the last, and the living one. I died, and behold I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades. Write therefore the things that you have seen, those that are and those that are to take place after this... — Revelation 1:17-19 (ESV)

From this we can assume that Jesus is the witness that is revealing what should "take place after this". The same witness continues his revelation through the remainder of chapter 1, 2 and in chapter 3 we read:

> The one who conquers, I will make him a pillar in the temple of **my God**. Never shall he go out of it, and I will write on him the name of **my God**, and the name of the city of **my God**, the new Jerusalem, which comes down from **my God** out of heaven, and my own new name." — Revelation 3:12 (ESV)

If this "witness" somehow silently switches to John, then why would John be the one who makes "the one who conquers" a "pillar in the temple" of God and why would John "write the name" of God on "the one who conquers"? From this we can assume that it is still Jesus speaking.

These testimonies from Jesus himself and from his closest followers consistently present Jesus as someone who has a God above him. This pattern supports understanding "Son of Man" as referring to the promised human offspring from Genesis 3:15, not God incarnate.

### Jesus's Baptism

Another significant detail about Jesus's identity comes from his baptism. Scripture tells us that God is not a man and not a son of man who should repent:

> "**God is not a man**, that He should lie, **nor a son of man**, that He should **repent**. — Numbers 23:19 (NKJV)

John's baptism was specifically described as a baptism of repentance:

> Then Paul said, "**John indeed baptized with a baptism of repentance**, saying to the people that they should believe on him who would come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus." — Acts 19:4 (NKJV)

Yet Jesus, who called himself the Son of Man, received this baptism:

> It came to pass in those days that **Jesus** came from Nazareth of Galilee, and **was baptized by John** in the Jordan. — Mark 1:9 (NKJV)

This action aligns with Jesus's identity as the Son of Man— the promised human offspring— rather than God himself.

## Paul's Apostolic Authority

A passage in Galatians is sometimes interpreted as evidence that Jesus was not a man:

> Paul, an apostle (not from men **nor through man, but through Jesus Christ** and God the Father who raised Him from the dead) ... — Galatians 1:1 (NKJV)

The context reveals that Paul was establishing the divine source of his apostolic authority. He was making clear that his authority to write these books came from no man-made institution, but directly from Jesus Christ and God the Father themselves.

Other translations clarify this distinction:

> Paul, an apostle (not commissioned and sent from men **nor through the agency of man, but through Jesus Christ — the Messiah — and God the Father**, who raised Him from the dead)... — Galatians 1:1 (AMP)

Paul's statement focuses on the divine source of his apostolic commission, not on denying Jesus's humanity. Throughout this article, the scriptures have shown how "Son of Man" identifies Jesus as the promised human offspring from Genesis 3:15. The one who would defeat the serpent. The scriptures consistently present Jesus using this title to describe his mission and role, which aligns with him being the fulfillment of God's promise to Eve, not God himself coming to earth.

## What This Means for You

Consider what it means that Jesus called himself the Son of Man. This title does not declare him to be God incarnate. It identifies him as the promised human offspring from Genesis 3:15. The one who would bruise the serpent's head.

When we understand "Son of Man" as referring to the promised offspring rather than "God as man," we grasp the beauty of God's plan. God did not promise to come personally to defeat the devil. He promised that the woman's offspring would accomplish this. Jesus fulfilled that promise as a man. A real human being who truly lived, suffered, and redeemed us from sin.

This understanding changes everything. It means you have a lord who truly knows your struggles because he faced them as a man. He didn't have an unfair advantage of being God in disguise. He was fully human and accomplished what Adam failed to do.

Will you let this truth reshape how you relate to Jesus? How might your faith deepen when you realize that the Son of Man is not God pretending to be human, but the promised offspring who genuinely shares your humanity?
