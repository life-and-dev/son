# A human Christ was prophesied

Many Jews reject Christianity because they expect a human Messiah (Christ), while the majority of [Christians](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/christian) teach that [Jesus is God](../son-as-god.md) or a "god-man" with both divine and human natures. This doctrine clashes with the Jewish Tanakh that teaches [there is only one God](../shema.md). Jewish sources explicitly affirm that [the Messiah will be "born of human parents" with "normal physical attributes"](https://www.simpletoremember.com/articles/a/jewsandjesus/#5), ["not a demi-god"](https://aish.com/why-jews-dont-believe-in-jesus/), and that the idea of God taking human form is considered idolatry. 

Tragically, the majority of Christian scholars require converts to believe that Jesus is "God" or at least "equal" to "God". This adherence to church tradition creates a barrier for many seeking truth. Unlike the church creeds stated, [this was never a requirement for salvation](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-man/salvation).

This has become a major hindrance preventing Jews and Muslims from accepting that Jesus is the Christ.

In the Bible we read that no prophet expected a god-man Christ with dual nature, nor that Christ would be God Himself, a mode of God, an avatar of God or possess any divine essence. Instead, the prophets consistently expected a purely human Christ who is a man empowered by God, not a deity incarnate. The prophecies describe:

## Jesus would be human

The prophecies describe the Messiah's human lineage, birth, and natural descent. They contain no mention of divine essence, supernatural origin, or dual nature. If the Messiah were to be a god-man, surely the prophets would have indicated this extraordinary characteristic. Yet they consistently point to ordinary human ancestry.

Adam and Eve expected a human descendant:

> The LORD God said to the serpent, ...
> 
> "I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and **her offspring**;
> **he shall bruise your head**, and you shall bruise his heel."
>
> — Genesis 3:14,15 (ESV)

Peter quoted Moses:

> For Moses truly said to the fathers,
>
>> The LORD your God will raise up for you **a Prophet like me** from your brethren. Him you shall hear in all things, whatever He says to you. And it shall be that every soul who will not hear that Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.’
>
> Yes, and all the prophets, from Samuel and those who follow, as many as have spoken, have also foretold these days. You are sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, And in your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed.’
>
> To you first, God, having **raised up His servant Jesus, sent him** to bless you, in turning away every one of you from your iniquities." — Acts 3:22-26 (NKJV)

Moses expected a human prophet:

> “The LORD your God will raise up for you **a Prophet like me** from your midst, from your brethren. Him you shall hear, according to all you desired of the LORD your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, nor let me see this great fire anymore, lest I die.’
>
> "And the LORD said to me: What they have spoken is good. I will raise up for them **a prophet like you from among their brethren**, and will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him. And it shall be that whoever will not hear My words, which he speaks in My name, I will require it of him.
>
> — Deuteronomy 18:15-19 (NKJV)

Jesus may have also referred to this prophecy:

> "For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote of me. But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?" — John 5:46-47 (ESV)

### Jesus would be a Jew

The prophecies specify the Messiah's tribal lineage (Judah) and family line (Jesse, David). These details emphasize his complete humanity and Jewish identity, not divine transcendence.

Jacob expected a human descendant of Judah to be the Christ:

> Then Jacob called his sons and said, "Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you what shall happen to you in days to come..."
>
> The scepter shall not depart **from Judah**, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until tribute comes to him; and to him shall be the obedience of the peoples.
>
> — Genesis 49:1,10 (ESV)

Isaiah expected a human Christ:

> There shall come forth **a shoot from the stump of Jesse**, and a branch from his roots shall bear fruit. — Isaiah 11:1 (ESV)

Jeremiah expected a human Christ:

> Their prince shall be one of themselves; their ruler shall come out from their midst; I will make him draw near, and he shall approach me, for who would dare of himself to approach me?
>
> declares the LORD.
>
> — Jeremiah 30:21 (ESV)

Matthew, the wise men and Herod expected a human Christ:

> So they *(wise men)* said to him *(Herod)*,
>
>> “In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet:  
>> ‘But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,  
>> **Are not the least among the rulers of Judah**;  
>> For out of you shall come a ruler  
>> Who will shepherd My people Israel.’ ”
>
> — Matthew 2:5-6 (NKJV)

This was probably a paraphrased quotation of Micah's prophecy:

> “But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,  
> **Though you are little among the thousands of Judah**,  
> Yet out of you shall come forth to Me  
> The one to be ruler in Israel,  
> Whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting.”
>
> Therefore he shall give them up,  
> Until the time that she who is in labor **has given birth**;  
> Then the remnant of his brethren  
> Shall return to the children of Israel.  
> And he shall stand and feed His flock  
> In the strength of the LORD,  
> In the majesty of the name of **the LORD his God**;  
> And they shall abide,  
> For now he shall be great  
> To the ends of the earth;  
> And this one shall be peace.
>
> — Micah 5:2-5 (NKJV)

## Jesus would be a servant of God

The prophets repeatedly identified the Messiah as God's "servant". This relationship presupposes distinction, subordination, and creatureliness. A divine being cannot serve himself; servanthood proves Jesus is not God but rather God's chosen human agent.

Jesus himself quoted Isaiah's prophecy which indicated that a human Christ was expected:

> But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew from there. And great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all. Yet he warned them not to make him known, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:
>
>> “Behold! **My servant** whom I have chosen,  
>> My beloved in whom My soul is well pleased!  
>> I will put My Spirit upon him,  
>> And he will declare justice to the gentiles.  
>> He will not quarrel nor cry out,  
>> Nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets.  
>> A bruised reed he will not break,  
>> And smoking flax he will not quench,  
>> Till he sends forth justice to victory;  
>> And in his name Gentiles will trust.”
>
> — Matthew 12:15-21 (NKJV)

Isaiah's prophecy:

> “Behold! **My servant** whom I uphold,  
> My elect one in whom My soul delights!  
> I have put My Spirit upon him;  
> He will bring forth justice to the gentiles.  
> He will not cry out, nor raise his voice,  
> Nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.  
> A bruised reed he will not break,  
> And smoking flax He will not quench;  
> He will bring forth justice for truth.  
> He will not fail nor be discouraged,  
> Till He has established justice in the earth;  
> And the coastlands shall wait for His law."
>
> — Isaiah 42:1-4 (NKJV)

Jesus fulfillment, recorded by Luke:

> For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in me *(Jesus)*:
>
>> "And he was numbered with the transgressors."
>
> For what is written about me has its fulfillment."
>
> — Luke 22:37 (ESV)

Isaiah's prophecy:

> Behold, [My servant](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/serve-god) shall act wisely; *(John 7:15-16)*  
> he shall be high and lifted up, and shall be exalted. *(Philippians 2:5-11)*  
> As many were astonished at you  
> (his appearance was so marred, beyond human semblance, and his form beyond that of the children of mankind)  
> so shall he sprinkle many nations.
>
> Kings shall shut their mouths because of him, for that which has not been told them they see, and that which they have not heard they understand.
>
> Who has believed what he has heard from us? *(Romans 10:16)*  
> And to whom has the arm of [the LORD](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/father/name#lord) been revealed?
>
> For he grew up before Him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground; *(Luke 2:52)*  
> he had no form or majesty that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him. *(John 7:24; Matthew 11:8)*
>
> He was despised and rejected by men, *(John 7:1-9; Matthew 11:9)*  
> a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief;  
> and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not.  
> Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows;  
> yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.
>
> But he was pierced for our [transgressions](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/transgression); he was crushed for our [iniquities](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/iniquity); *(John 12:27; Galatians 2:21)*  
> upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed.
>
> All we like sheep have gone astray; *(John 10:11-18; Mark 14:27)*  
> we have turned — every one — to his own way;  
> and [the LORD](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/father/name#lord) has laid on him the [iniquity](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/iniquity) of us all.
>
> He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth;  
> like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth. *(John 1:29, 1 Peter 1:19, Revelation 1:17)*
>
> By oppression and judgment he was taken away;  
> and as for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living, stricken for the [transgression](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/transgression) of my people?
>
> And they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death, although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth.  
> Yet it was the will of [the LORD](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/father/name#lord) to crush him;  
> he has put him to grief;  
> when his soul makes an [offering](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/sacrifice) for guilt, he shall see his offspring; he shall prolong his days;  
> the will of [the LORD](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/father/name#lord) shall prosper in his hand.
>
> Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied;  
> by his knowledge shall the righteous one, My servant, make many to be accounted righteous, and he shall bear their iniquities.  
> Therefore I will divide him a portion with the many, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong, *(Revelation 1:5-6)*  
> because he poured out his soul to death and ***was numbered with the transgressors***; *(Luke 22:37)*  
> yet he bore the sin of many, and makes intercession for the transgressors.
>
> — Isaiah 52:13-53:12 (ESV)

Both Peter and David expected a human Christ:

> Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth... For David says concerning him,
>
>> ‘I saw the [LORD](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/father/name) always before me, for He is at my right hand that I may not be shaken;  
>> therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; my flesh also will dwell in hope.  
>> For You will not abandon my soul to Hades, or let Your **holy one** see corruption.  
>> You have made known to me the paths of life; You will make me full of gladness with Your presence.’
>
> Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne, he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses. Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing.
>
> — Acts 2:22,25-34 (ESV)

Peter quoted David's "Miktam":

> I have set the LORD always before me; because He is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken.  
> Therefore my heart is glad, and my whole being rejoices; my flesh also dwells secure.  
> For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol, or let Your **holy one** see corruption.  
> You make known to me the path of life; in Your presence there is fullness of joy; at Your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
>
> — Psalm 16:8-11 (ESV)

Psalm 16 is written in first person on behalf of Jesus. Peter explains that Christ fulfilled David's prophecy, because Jesus:

* is one of David's "descendants";
* "died and was buried" (like a human);
* had "flesh" (like a human);
* had been "raised up" (not being a perfect God since birth);
* had been "exalted" (implying that he would not be almighty);
* is "at the right hand of God" (implying that he is not God Himself);
* had "received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit" (implying the Father and the Holy Spirit are not Jesus)

## Jesus would die

Multiple prophecies predicted the Messiah's death. This detail fundamentally contradicts any claim of divine nature, since God is immortal (Romans 1:22-23; 1 Timothy 1:17). No prophet expected an immortal deity who merely *appeared* to die or whose "human nature" died while his "divine nature" remained alive. They expected a genuine, complete human death, the end of a mortal man's life.

When we analyze [Daniel 9:24-27](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/prophecies#daniel-9-24-27), it shows that Daniel knew the Messiah would be "cut off" (killed). 

Both Matthew and Mark quoted Zechariah:

> And Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away, for it is written,
>
>> 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'"
>
> — Mark 14:27 (ESV); Matthew 26:31

Zechariah's prophecy:

> “Awake, O sword, against My shepherd, against the man who stands next to me,” declares the LORD of hosts.
>
> ***“Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered;***  
> I will turn my hand against the little ones.  
> In the whole land, declares the LORD, two thirds shall be cut off and perish, and one third shall be left alive.  
> And I will put this third into the fire, and refine them as one refines silver, and test them as gold is tested.
>
> They will call upon My name, and I will answer them.
>
> I will say, 'They are My people'; and they will say, 'The LORD is my God.'"
>
> — Zechariah 13:7-9 (ESV)

## Jesus is distinct from God

The prophetic visions consistently show the Messiah as separate from God. They depict him standing before God's throne, receiving revelation from God, and distinguished from "Him who sits on the throne." This clear distinction is incompatible with the claim that Jesus is God himself or possesses divine essence.

Daniel saw [the Ancient of Days](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/father/ancient-of-days) distinct from Jesus.

In the Book of Revelation:

Christ received a revelation from God. A revelation given to oneself is not revelation at all.

> The Revelation of Jesus Christ, **which God gave him** to show His servants — things which must shortly take place. — Revelation 1:1 (NKJV)

It would not make sense to claim Jesus is God because if that was true, then there would be no revelation at all because he would already know what he is about to "reveal" to himself.

John saw in the book of Revelation:

> Grace to you and peace from **Him who is and who was and who is to come**, and from the seven spirits who are before **His throne**, and from **Jesus Christ** the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth. — Revelation 1:4-5 (ESV)

Jesus Christ is addressed as a separate person from "Him who is and who was and who is to come".

Revelation 4 provides more detail of the throne room:

> At once I was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne stood in heaven, with **one seated on the throne**... — Revelation 4:2

Then later, separately from the "one seated on the throne"...

> And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?" And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it, and I began to weep loudly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it. And one of the elders said to me, "Weep no more; behold, the Lion [of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David](#jesus-would-be-a-jew), has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals."
>
> And between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders I saw **a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain**...
>
> — Revelation 5:2-6 (ESV)

Which symbolizes that Jesus is separate from God. The "Lamb" was not the "one seated on the throne".

## Conclusion

The cumulative weight of prophecy overwhelmingly supports the expectation of a purely human Messiah:

- **[Human lineage](#jesus-would-be-human)**: Descended from woman, Abraham, Judah, Jesse, and David
- **[Natural birth](#jesus-would-be-a-jew)**: Born of human parents in Bethlehem
- **[Mortal nature](#jesus-would-die)**: Subject to suffering, death, and burial
- **[Servant relationship](#jesus-would-be-a-servant-of-god)**: Subordinate to God, empowered by God's Spirit
- **[Distinct identity](#jesus-is-distinct-from-god)**: Separate from God, seated at God's right hand

Not one prophecy hints at divine essence, dual nature, incarnation, or a god-man hybrid. The Jewish rejection of Christianity's deity claims is thus rooted in faithful adherence to the actual prophetic testimony. The Messiah the prophets expected was fully and exclusively human. He remains so today.
