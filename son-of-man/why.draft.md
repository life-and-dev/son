# Why Jesus Had to Be Human

### The Last Adam / Second Adam

Paul called Jesus the "Last Adam" or "Second Adam" in Scripture:

> "For as by a man came death, by a man has dcome also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive." (1 Corinthians 15:21-22)

> "Thus it is written, 'The first man Adam became a living being'; **the last Adam** became a life-giving spirit. The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven." (1 Corinthians 15:45,47)

> "For as by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so **by the one man's obedience** the many will be made righteous." (Romans 5:19)

Notice the repeated emphasis: "by a **man**" ... "one **man's** obedience."

**Why does this matter?**

### What Adam Failed, Jesus Succeeded

**Adam:**
- Given dominion over creation (Genesis 1:26-28)
- Placed in God's presence (Genesis 2:8,15)
- Given a test (tree of knowledge - Genesis 2:16-17)
- **Failed the test** through disobedience (Genesis 3:6)
- Forfeited human right to rule (Genesis 3:23-24)

**Jesus:**
- Born as fully human (1 Timothy 2:5)
- Faced temptation just like Adam (Matthew 4:1-11)
- **Passed the test** through obedience (Philippians 2:8)
- Reclaimed human right to rule (Acts 2:36; Matthew 28:18)

**Here's the profound point:** If Jesus was God, nothing is proven. God cannot fail, cannot be tempted (James 1:13), cannot disobey Himself. A divine being resisting temptation tells us nothing about human potential.

But if Jesus was fully **HUMAN** (empowered by the Holy Spirit, just as we can be), then everything is proven:
- Humans CAN obey God by His Spirit (Romans 8:4)
- Humans CAN resist temptation by His power (1 Corinthians 10:13)
- Humans CAN fulfill their original purpose (Matthew 5:16)
- Humans CAN be restored to dominion under God (Psalm 8:6)

> "God anointed Jesus of Nazareth **with the Holy Spirit and with power**. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him." (Acts 10:38)

Jesus operated by the Holy Spirit, not inherent divinity. This makes his obedience meaningful and his example achievable.

### The Mediator Must Be Human

> "For there is one God, and there is **one mediator** between God and men, **the MAN Christ Jesus**." (1 Timothy 2:5)

Not "the God Christ Jesus" but "the **MAN** Christ Jesus."

Why must the mediator be human?

**1. Humans Cannot Interact with Unveiled God:**

When God appeared at Mount Sinai, the people were terrified:

> "Now when all the people saw the thunder and the flashes of lightning and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking, the people were afraid and trembled, and they stood far off and said to Moses, **'You speak to us, and we will listen; but do not let God speak to us, lest we die.'**" (Exodus 20:18-19)

> "But," he said, "you cannot see my face, for **man shall not see me and live**." (Exodus 33:20)

> "No one has ever seen God." (John 1:18)

Humans need a mediator—someone who can represent them to God and God to them.

**2. To Restore Humanity to Original Purpose:**

God's original design was for humans to have dominion over creation (Genesis 1:26-28). Adam forfeited this right. If God simply ruled directly, the original design would be abandoned.

Jesus, as HUMAN, reclaims the human right to rule. He fulfills what Adam failed to accomplish:

> "What is man that you are mindful of him, and the son of man that you care for him? Yet you have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and **crowned him with glory and honor**. You have given him **dominion over the works of your hands**; you have put **all things under his feet**." (Psalm 8:4-6)

This psalm describes humanity's original calling. The New Testament applies it specifically to Jesus—the human who fulfilled what humanity was meant to be.

**3. To Set an Achievable Example:**

> "For we do not have a high priest who is unable to **sympathize with our weaknesses**, but one who in every respect **has been tempted as we are**, yet without sin." (Hebrews 4:15)

If Jesus was God, his example is meaningless to us. We cannot be God. But if Jesus was human empowered by the Holy Spirit (the same Spirit available to us - Acts 2:38), then his example is achievable.

### A Note on Jesus' Nature

The question of Jesus' exact nature (fully human vs. God incarnate vs. both) has been debated for centuries. While this article emphasizes Jesus' humanity—which Scripture clearly and repeatedly affirms (1 Timothy 2:5; 1 Corinthians 15:21-22,45; Romans 5:19; Hebrews 4:15)—we recognize that sincere believers hold different views.

What matters most is recognizing that Jesus' humanity is **essential**, not incidental. Without genuine humanity, Jesus cannot be the "Last Adam," cannot truly be tempted, cannot reclaim human dominion, and cannot set an example we can follow.
