# The Trinity

When I first studied [the Bible](https://word.ofgod.info) as a new believer, I accepted the Trinity as fundamental Christian truth. After all, nearly every church, seminary, and creed taught it as essential doctrine. But as I dug deeper into Scripture, historical documents, and early church writings, troubling questions emerged:

- If the Trinity is central to Christianity, why do [even Trinitarian scholars admit the doctrine isn't found in the Bible?](https://thegodofjesus.com/reasons-to-believe/shocking-admissions)
- How could the apostles preach salvation without ever mentioning it in their letters?
- Why did it take over 300 years after Christ for the church to formalize this doctrine?
- Why are there so [many variations of the Trinity doctrine](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/godhead/according-to-scholars) and which one is correcct?

This article examines the evidence, both historical and biblical, to help you understand what the Trinity really is, where it came from, and whether it aligns with the teachings of Jesus and His apostles. My goal isn't to attack sincere believers, but to encourage you to search the Scriptures like the Bereans and let God's Word speak for itself.

> When I first began to study the Bible years ago, the doctrine of [the Trinity was one of the most complex problems](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/godhead/according-to-scholars) I had to encounter. I have never fully resolved it, for [it contains an aspect of mystery](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/mystery). Though I do not totally understand it to this day, **I accept it as a revelation of God**. — [Billy Graham](https://sermons.faithlife.com/sermons/293145-god:-the-person)

Most Christians agree that God is 1 *"[Godhead](#the-word-godhead)"* which is *somehow* a union of 3 divine persons. Many additionally claim that each member of the *"Godhead"* is *"equal"*.

## Vocabulary

While some unbiblical words had to be invented to explain the Trinitarian Doctrine, the Trinitarians argue that these concepts are as old as their bibles.

### The word "trinity"

Catholic scholars admit that Tertullian was the FIRST writer to use the term "trinity" (Latin: "trinitas").

> Tertullian originated new theological concepts and advanced the development of early Church doctrine. He is perhaps most famous for being the first writer in Latin known to use the term trinity (Latin: trinitas). -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertullian) ("Tertullian, Originator of the Trinity", From Logos to Trinity, Cambridge University Press, pp. 190–220, 2012-01-30, doi:10.1017/cbo9781139003971.010, ISBN 9781139003971, retrieved 2022-08-20)

Some believe this came from pagan influences involving worship of three gods. This concept was later developed in Origen's theology (the greatest scholar and father of Latin Catholic theology, 180-254 AD).

### The word "Godhead"

Also known as ["Godhood"](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/godhead).

> the nature of God especially as existing in three persons -- [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/godhead)

[John Wycliffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wycliffe) was [the first who added this word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godhead_in_Christianity) to the Bible in 14th century to explain the Trinity.

## Why Christians belief in the Trinity

### Father, Son and Spirit is God

1. The Father is God (1 Corinthians 8:6; Psalm 68:5; Matthew 23:9)
2. The Son is God (according to the Trinitarians [by a variety of reasons](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/as-god))
3. The Holy Spirit is God (implied by Peter in Acts 5:3-4)

If all 3 are God but there can only be 1 God (Deuteronomy 6:4, Mark 12:29), then this "contradiction" supports the trinity doctrine.

However, [the word "God"](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/god) which comes from the Hebrew word ("elohim") or Greek word ("theos") could have different meanings depending on the context. For example, if people address someone or something as "God" in Greek or Hebrew, it could mean they are worshipping Him, but it could also mean they have the greatest possible respect for him.

### "Elohim" is plural

In general the Hebrew word "Elohim" which means gods in plural. This lead some to belief that [the plural God](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/godhead#the-plural-god) refers to the members of [the Godhead](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/godhead).

However, in the Bible, the word "Elohim" could also [technically be considered a singular God](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/godhead#the-plural-god) for example:
* Moses was considered "elohim" (Exodus 7:1)
* A single idol was considered "elohim" (Exodus 22:20)
* Baal was considered "elohim" (Judges 6:31)
* Chemosh was considered "elohim" (Judges 11:24)
* Dagon was considered "elohim" (1 Samuel 5:7)

### God does godly things in partnership

Often God partners with someone and use the words "us" or "our" to do divine things. For example Genesis 1:26; 3:22; 11:7.

Unfortunately the scripture does not name God's partner(s) directly which lead Trinitarians to belief that God was referring to the members of [the Godhead](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/godhead). However, this is purely an assumption because [the LORD of hosts](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/father) could also be [partnering with His angels ("hosts") or Cherubim](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/godhead#god-doing-divine-things-in-partnership), [mankind](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/godhead#people-make-people), and prophets (Isaiah 6:8, 48:16).

### God is "unified"

Trinitarians argue that "God is one" actually means ["God is unified"](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/godhead#god-is-unified) which is supposed to mean "God is made up of 3 united members". However, the same Hebrew and Greek words for "one" could also mean "only", "alone", "single" or even "united" depending on the context or interpretation.

### The 3 men that appeared to Abraham

Some Christians claim that the 3 men who appeared to Abraham in Genesis 18 are the Godhead in 3 different persons:

> And the LORD ([YHVH](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/father/name)) appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat at the door of his tent in the heat of the day. He lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, [three men](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/doctrines/trinitarian/3-men) were standing in front of him. When he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the earth and said, "O Lord, if I have found favor in your sight, do not pass by your servant." -- Genesis 18:1-3 (ESV)

Some argue that these [3 men](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/doctrines/trinitarian/3-men) were the 3 members of [the Godhead](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/godhead) that appeared to Abraham.

Yet, there are no evidence that [God appears](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/father/appearance) as a "man" that you can invite for dinner to anyone. It was most likely 3 [angels who spoke on behalf of God](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/angel) to Abraham.

### Paul listed 3 "members" of God

Trinitarians argue that Paul lists the 3 members of the Trinity:

> 1. Now there are varieties of gifts, but [the same Spirit](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/spirit);
> 2. and there are varieties of service, [*but*](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/1_corinthians/12-5.htm) [the same Lord](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son) (Jesus as per 1 Corinthians 12:3);
> 3. and there are varieties of activities [~~also~~](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/1_corinthians/12-6.htm), but it is [the same God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/father) who empowers them all in everyone.
>
> -- 1 Corinthians 12:4-6 (ESV)

Problems:

Paul named the third "member" simply "God", but not the other two. The last part of the scripture is often ignored:

> ... but it is [the same God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/father) **who empowers them all in everyone**.

Which means the same God empowers the "gifts" and "services" though His "Spirit" and "Lord Jesus".

Another problem is that English bible translators manipulate the text to fit their view. For example:

* The second "member" does not contain a "but" like the first "member". Instead, the word is ["kai" which means "and" or "even" or "also" or "namely"](https://biblehub.com/greek/2532.htm). The last "member"'s "kai" is even left out from the translation.
* Verse separation was added afterwords by translators and was not part of the original manuscripts.

In other words, a more direct translation would probably be something like:

> Now there are varieties of gifts,<br/>
> but the same Spirit and there are varieties of service **and** the same Lord and there are varieties of activities **also**,<br/>
> but it is the same God who empowers them all in everyone.

### Biased bible translations

Often modern bible translators defend the Trinitarian doctrine with biased translations, instead of translating what the original text originally meant to say. For example:

* [Matthew 28:19](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/doctrines/trinitarian/matt-28-19)
* [John 1:18](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/doctrines/trinitarian/john-1-18)
* [1 John 5:7-8](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/doctrines/trinitarian/1-john-5)

### Paul's blessing

> 1. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and
> 2. the love of God and
> 3. the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
>
> be with you all.
>
> -- 2 Corinthians 13:14 (ESV)

This verse does not list the Trinity members. Instead, Paul conclude with the 3 main topics of his letter and bless his readers with the information thereof.

### God is mysterious

Often people will reason that you should not try to understand [the mystery of God](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/mystery#mystery-of-gods-essence) or ask too many questions about [God's essence](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence).  This is a very convenient counterargument to cancel any contradiction in scripture or logic.

However, they often misunderstand what [the true meaning of the word "mystery"](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/mystery) really is. 

## Critique

### Missing evidence

* There are no scriptures that define God as being Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
* There are no scriptures that define God as 3, 3 in 1, or a combination of personalities, parts, modes or aspects.
* The Jewish Rabbis, Scribes, Pharisees, and Priests spend a great deal of time studying the Tanach (Old Testament) in their own language. If there was any proof of a Trinity, they would have noticed it. Yet we see through history the Jews fiercely defended the facts that there is only one God.
* There are no scriptures that say that Jesus has two natures or two minds or that he is a God-man, or that he is fully God and fully man.
* There are no scriptures of people praying to Jesus (except face to face conversations).
* There are no scriptures of people praying to the Holy Spirit.
* There are no scriptures of people worshipping the Holy Spirit.

### The definition of the Trinity is inconsistent

> Trinitarians differ, sometimes greatly, in their definitions of the Trinity. The Eastern Orthodox Church differs from the Western Church on the relation of the Holy Spirit to the Father and the Son. Also, Trinitarians who hold to the “classic” definition of the Trinity, that Jesus was 100% God and 100% man while on earth, believe differently from Kenotic Trinitarians, who believe that Jesus set aside his godhood while he was a man on earth.
>
> ...
>
> A study of the history of the Christian Church shows a definite development in the doctrine of the Trinity over the centuries. For example, the early form of the Apostles’ Creed, believed to date back to shortly after the time of the apostles themselves, does not mention the Trinity or the dual nature of Christ. Furthermore, it only states, “I believe in ‘the holy spirit,’” which could just as easily refer to the gift of holy spirit as it could to a third “Person” in the Trinity. The Nicene Creed, written in 325 AD and modified later, added the material about Jesus Christ being “eternally begotten” and “true God,” and about the Holy Spirit being “Lord.” But it was the Athanasian Creed, most likely composed in the late 400s or early 500s AD, that was the first creed to explicitly state the doctrine of the Trinity, and it includes that if a person does not believe it, he is not saved but will perish everlastingly.

### People got saved without knowing about the Trinity

| Scripture               | Description                                                                                          |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Luke 7:36-50            | Jesus converted a woman [without telling her that he is God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/salvation).    |
| Acts 2:14-47            | Peter converted 3000 people [without telling them Jesus is God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/salvation). |
| Acts 13:13-44; 17:22-34 | Paul converted people [without telling them Jesus is God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/salvation).       |   

### Jesus was not God

[Scripture show that Jesus was not God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god), but instead he was considered [the Son of God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/of-god). Therefore, he could not have qualified to be a member of the Trinity.

### The apostle's greetings

#### Paul name only 2 members of the Trinity

Note that the Holy Spirit is always missing from Paul's blessings, which implies that Paul did not consider the Holy Spirit important enough to be considered as part of the "Trinity".

Paul mentions:

* God our Father
* Lord Jesus Christ
* ***but the Holy Spirit is missing***

> Paul, a bondservant of **Jesus Christ**, called to be an apostle, separated to the gospel of **God** which He promised before through His Prophets in the Holy Scriptures, concerning **His son Jesus Christ our Lord**... -- Romans 1:1-3 (NKJV)

> Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all who in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours: Grace to you and peace from **God our Father** and the **Lord Jesus Christ**. -- 1 Corinthians 1:1-2 (NKJV)

> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in all Achaia: Grace to you and peace from **God our Father** and the **Lord Jesus Christ**. -- 2 Corinthians 1:1-2 (NKJV)

> Paul, an apostle (not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and **God the Father** who raised Him from the dead), and all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia: Grace to you and peace from **God the Father** and our **Lord Jesus Christ**, who gave Himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil age, according to the will of our **God and Father**, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen -- Galatians 1:1-4 (NKJV)

> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints who are in Ephesus, and faithful in Christ Jesus: Grace to you and peace from **God our Father** and the **Lord Jesus Christ**. -- Ephesians 1:1-2 (NKJV)

> Paul and Timothy, bondservants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the bishops and deacons: Grace to you and peace from **God our Father** and the **Lord Jesus Christ**. -- Philippians 1:1-2 (NKJV)

> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are in Colosse: Grace to you and peace from **God our Father** and the **Lord Jesus Christ**. -- Colossians 1:1-2 (NKJV)

> Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in **God the Father** and the **Lord Jesus Christ**. -- 1 Thessalonians 1:1 (ESV)

> Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in **God our Father** and the **Lord Jesus Christ**. -- 2 Thessalonians 1:1 (ESV)

> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope, to Timothy, my true child in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from **God the Father** and **Christ Jesus our Lord**. -- 1 Timothy 1:1-2 (ESV)

> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God according to the promise of the life that is in Christ Jesus, to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace from **God the Father** and **Christ Jesus our Lord**. -- 2 Timothy 1:1-2 (ESV)

> Paul, a servant of God and aan apostle of Jesus Christ, for the sake of the faith of God’s elect and their knowledge of the truth, which accords with godliness, in hope of eternal life, which God, who never lies, promised before the ages began and at the proper time manifested in his word through the preaching with which I have been entrusted by the command of God our Savior; To Titus, my true child in ma common faith: Grace and peace from **God the Father** and **Christ Jesus our Savior**. -- Titus 1:1-4 (ESV)

> Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved fellow worker and Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier, and the church in your house: Grace to you and peace from **God our Father** and the **Lord Jesus Christ**. -- Philemon 1:1-3 (ESV)

#### James name only 2 members of the Trinity

James mentions:

* God
* Lord Jesus Christ
* ***but the Holy Spirit is missing***

> James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes in the Dispersion: Greetings. -- James 1:1 (ESV)

#### Peter name only 2 members of the Trinity

Peter mentions:

* God the Father
* Jesus Christ
* the Spirit (missing in the second letter of Peter)

However, in the context of 1 Peter:1, "the Spirit" is complementing the "blood", but the "blood" is not considered as a fourth member of the Trinity.

> Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who are elect exiles of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, according to the foreknowledge of
>
> * **God the Father** in the sanctification of ***the Spirit***,
> * for obedience to **Jesus Christ** and for sprinkling with ***his blood***:
>   May grace and peace be multiplied to you.
>
> -- 1 Peter 1:1-2 (ESV)

If the Spirit is proven to be "God" by this greeting, then the "blood" should also be a "god" making the Trinity 4 members not 3.

> Simeon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained aa faith of equal standing with ours by the righteousness of **our God** and **Savior Jesus Christ**: May grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of **God** and of **Jesus our Lord**. -- 2 Peter 1:1-2 (ESV)

#### John name only 2 members of the Trinity

John mentions:

* God the Father
* Jesus Christ the Father's Son
* ***but the Holy Spirit is missing***

> That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we looked upon and have touched with our hands, concerning the word of life — the life was made manifest, and we have seen it, and testify to it and proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was made manifest to us — that which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you, so that you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with **the Father** and with His son **Jesus Christ**. And we are writing these things so that our joy may be complete. -- 1 John 1:1-4 (ESV)

> The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all who know the truth, because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever: Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from **God the Father** and from **Jesus Christ** the Father’s Son, in truth and love. -- 2 John 1:1-3 (ESV)

> The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth. -- 3 John 1:1 (ESV)

#### Jude name only 2 members of the Trinity

Jude mentions:

* God the Father
* Jesus Christ
* ***but the Holy Spirit is missing***

> Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James, to those who are called, beloved in **God the Father** and kept for **Jesus Christ**. -- Jude 1:1 (ESV)

#### The author of Hebrew name only 2 members of the Trinity

The author mentions:

* God of peace
* our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd
* ***but the Holy Spirit is missing***

> Now may the **God of peace** who brought again from the dead **our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd** of the sheep, by the blood of the eternal covenant, equip you with everything good that you may do His will, working in us that which is pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. -- Hebrews 13:20-21 (ESV)

### How God looks

The Trinity doctrine fails when Daniel (Daniel 7:14), Stephan (Acts 7:55-56) and John (Revelation 4:2 and 5:2-6) saw [Jesus as a distinct person from God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/distinct).

### Singular pronouns

According to [Spirit & Truth Fellowship International](https://www.biblicalunitarian.com/why-bu), there are over 20,000 singular pronouns, like "I", "My", and "He" which refers to God. If God was a collection of different members, then these pronouns would not make sense.

## What Should You Believe?

Having examined the historical evidence, biblical references, and logical consistency of Trinitarian doctrine, you now face a choice.

Will you accept tradition simply because "that's what the church teaches," or will you search the Scriptures yourself like the Bereans in Acts 17:11?

I'm not asking you to abandon your faith. I'm asking you to deepen it. Here's what you can do:

1. **Study the passages** cited in this article. Read them in their full context, not just isolated verses.
2. **Ask honest questions**. If the Trinity is essential for salvation, why didn't the apostles explicitly teach it? Why is it missing from their greetings and letters?
3. **Pray for wisdom**. Ask God to reveal the truth to you through His Word, not through human tradition.
4. **Consider the effects**. Does the Trinity doctrine bring you closer to the Father, or does it create confusion and complexity?
