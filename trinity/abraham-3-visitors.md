# The 3 that appeared to Abraham

Genesis 18 has generated theological debate regarding whether the three men who appeared to Abraham represent the Trinity. God in three distinct persons. The argument appears compelling at first glance. The text says "the LORD appeared" (singular), yet three men showed up at Abraham's tent. This has led some to interpret the passage as an early revelation of [the Godhead](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/godhead) in human form.

> And the LORD ([YHVH](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/father/name)) appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat at the door of his tent in the heat of the day. He lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, three men were standing in front of him. When he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the earth and said, "O Lord, if I have found favor in your sight, do not pass by your servant." -- Genesis 18:1-3 (ESV)

A closer examination of the passage and its context reveals that this interpretation raises more questions than it answers. If Abraham truly saw God the Father in physical form, how does that harmonize with Jesus' statement that "no one has ever seen God" (John 1:18 (ESV))? Why does the very next chapter explicitly call two of these visitors "angels" (Genesis 19:1 (ESV))? 

## Abraham recognized YHVH

> So the men turned from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham still stood before **the LORD** *([YHVH](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/father/name))*. -- Genesis 18:22 (ESV)

However, if Abraham was physically standing before the Father, it could contradict Jesus' words:

> [No one has ever seen God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/father/appearance); the only God, who is at **the Father’s side**, he has made him known. -- John 1:18 (ESV)

Some use these verses to prove that this "man" referred as the LORD (YHVH) could be [an early incarnation of Jesus](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/as-god/incarnation) and because the LORD (YHVH) is God, they argue that this proves that [Jesus is God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence). Possible explanations:

1. Some believe Abraham was dreaming or seeing a vision while sleeping under the "oaks of Mamre" during his midday nap. However, the text does not confirm this. Sodom was really destroyed. It was not Abraham's imagination.
2. The "man" was most likely an angel (Genesis 19:1 (ESV)) appearing in the form of a "man" but speaking on behalf of the LORD (YHVH), just as prophets often did. When Abraham addressed "the LORD," he was speaking to the LORD because the messenger spoke His words with His authority. Similarly, when an ambassador speaks, we say "France announced" or "The President said." The ambassador physically stands before us, but represents someone else entirely. The messenger's physical presence doesn't make them the one they represent.

The reason why there are great confusion regarding this passage is because of the division between Genesis chapter 18 and 19 (that did not exist in the original text). In the next chapter we read:

> The **two angels** came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. -- Genesis 19:1 (ESV)

This implies the 3rd "man" stayed behind with Abraham to continue the conversation at the end of Genesis 18. No text clearly specifies what the 3rd "man" was. 

Since Abraham addressed the 3rd "man" as the LORD (YHVH), it is commonly assumed the 3rd man was YHVH Himself. However, several considerations challenge this assumption:

* If this was true, then YHVH's full glory would have killed Abraham (Exodus 33:20 (ESV)).
* There are also no other examples in the Bible where YHVH appeared as a "man" to anyone (Numbers 23:19 (ESV)).
* YHVH is not a shape-shifter (Malachi 3:6 (ESV)).
* Often YHVH communicated through [messengers](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/angel) like angels, prophets, scripture and even nature, but the times when He "appears", He does not look like an ordinary man whom one can invite for dinner like Abraham did. For example:
  * Genesis 3:8 (ESV): Adam and Eve only heard and experienced God's presence
  * Exodus 24:9-12 (ESV): Moses and the leaders of Israel only saw God's feet and heard His voice. Later Moses, requested to see more of God, which was denied (Exodus 33:15-20 (ESV))
  * Daniel 7:10 (ESV): Daniel saw a vision of "the Ancient of Days" as someone with a white garment and hair, but with fiery flames, burning wheels and streams that came forth from Him. Definitely not an ordinary "man".
  * Mark 1:9-11 (ESV): The people only heard God and saw His spirit "like a dove".
  * Acts 7:49 (ESV): Stephen saw God, but did not identify Him as another "man" next to Jesus.
  * Revelation: John saw a vision of God and described Him as the One Who sat on the throne, but John only describes His throne and what he sees around the throne. It is possibly that the light radiating from God was so intense that he could not properly see Him.

## At least 2 of the men were angels

The 2 angels also appeared as normal "men" to the men of Sodom:

> But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter: And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, "Where are the **men** which came in to thee this night? Bring them out unto us, that we may know them." -- Genesis 19:4-5 (KJV)

In Genesis 19:12 (ESV) these "angels" are referred again as "men".

> Then **the men** said to Lot... "For **we are about to destroy this place**, because the outcry against its people has become great before the LORD, and **the LORD has sent us** to destroy it." -- Genesis 19:12-13 (ESV)

These angels were acting under the authority of the LORD, and they referred to the LORD as a separate superior God. For example:

> Then **the LORD** rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven; -- Genesis 19:24 (ESV)

Even in modern English we don't blame the individual soldier who attacks a country. We say something like "Russia attacked Ukraine" as the Russian soldiers acted under the command of the Russian government. In the same way these angels acted under the command of "the LORD".

Lot also never directly addressed these angels as "YHVH", but as "Lords" in lowercase (Genesis 19:2 (ESV)) which is a form of respect to someone important.

## Common Objections Addressed

### "Abraham worshiped them — you don't worship angels!"

Some argue that Abraham's bowing and worship proves these were divine persons, citing Revelation 19:10 (ESV) and Revelation 22:8-9 (ESV) where angels reject worship. However, ancient Near Eastern culture practiced prostration before important visitors as respectful greeting, not necessarily worship. Abraham used the same gesture with ordinary men (Genesis 23:7 (ESV)) and the Hittites (Genesis 23:12 (ESV)). The Hebrew word *shachah* means "bow down" and indicates respect appropriate to the recipient. Abraham addressed them as *adonai* ("lord/master"), the same term servants used for human masters. This is not the divine name YHVH.

### "The text says YHVH stood before Abraham, not 'a messenger'"

Genesis 18:22 (ESV) states Abraham stood before "the LORD" (YHVH), seemingly proving God's physical presence. Compare this to Exodus 3:2-6 (ESV). The text says "the angel of the LORD appeared" in the burning bush, yet immediately afterward "God called to him" and said "I am the God of your father." The angel represented God so completely that Scripture attributes the words directly to God. Similarly, Judges 6:11-14 (ESV) shows the angel of the LORD appearing to Gideon, yet verse 14 says "the LORD turned to him." This Old Testament pattern shows angels could speak with such complete divine authority that the text uses God's name directly, just as we say both "the ambassador said" and "France announced."

### "Only God knows the future — angels can't predict it"

Genesis 18:17-19 (ESV) shows the LORD knowing Abraham's future and divine plans, which some claim proves this was God Himself. However, angels regularly received and relayed divine knowledge. Gabriel explained future events to Daniel (Daniel 9:21-23 (ESV)) and announced Jesus' birth (Luke 1:19 (ESV)). Prophets spoke future events revealed by God without being God themselves. The messenger having revealed knowledge doesn't mean the messenger is God in essence. It means God chose to reveal His plans through that messenger.

### "Singular/plural switching proves the Trinity"

The text alternates between singular ("he said") and plural ("they said"), which some interpret as evidence for "three persons, one God." However, this simply reflects Abraham initially addressing all three visitors, then focusing on the chief messenger. Genesis 19:1-2 (ESV) shows the same pattern. Lot addresses "my lords" (plural) even though both are angels of equal nature. Hebrew narrative often switches between collective and individual perspectives when describing groups. This is a literary device, not a theological statement about God's nature.

### "Angels can't eat physical food"

Genesis 18:8 (ESV) describes the visitors eating Abraham's meal, which some argue proves incarnation rather than angelic appearance. However, angels appearing in human form interact physically throughout Scripture. They pulled Lot inside his house (Genesis 19:10 (ESV)) and grasped his family's hands (Genesis 19:16 (ESV)). Angels taking temporary physical form to accomplish a mission differs fundamentally from incarnation. The permanent union of divine and human nature in Christ (John 1:14 (ESV)) is a distinct theological category.

### "But the third man could still be God or pre-incarnate Christ"

While the text doesn't explicitly call the third visitor an angel, the pattern strongly suggests it. Two are identified as angels, all three appeared together in the same manner, and Genesis 19:13 (ESV) quotes the angels saying "the LORD has sent us." This shows even the destroyers of Sodom acted under authority, not as autonomous divine persons. The burden of proof rests on the extraordinary claim. If someone was God in human form, we should expect explicit scriptural statement, not inference. The Angel of the LORD pattern throughout the Old Testament consistently shows divine messengers, not divine essence incarnate.

### "Church tradition has interpreted this as the Trinity for centuries"

It's true that Christian art has depicted Abraham's visitors as the Trinity. However, church tradition, while valuable, isn't infallible. The early church fathers themselves disagreed on this passage's interpretation. More importantly, Scripture itself must be our final authority.

## Hermeneutical Considerations

The chapter division between Genesis 18 and 19 obscures a crucial fact. These "men" are explicitly identified as "angels" in Genesis 19:1 (ESV). While Abraham addressed "the LORD," the angel likely spoke with God's authority, just as ambassadors represent their nations and prophets declared "Thus says the LORD."

Common objections regarding worship, divine knowledge, physical interaction, and church tradition each have biblical answers grounded in ancient Near Eastern culture, the prophetic pattern of revelation, and angelic capabilities demonstrated throughout Scripture. This interpretation aligns with the broader biblical pattern. God is spirit (John 4:24 (ESV)), seeing His full glory is fatal (Exodus 33:20 (ESV)), and no one has seen the Father (John 1:18 (ESV)). The consistent pattern shows God communicating through authorized messengers rather than casual appearances as dinner guests.

Sound biblical interpretation requires examining full context, comparing Scripture with Scripture, and seeking harmonization with God's revealed character. How one passage is read affects understanding of the entire biblical narrative.
