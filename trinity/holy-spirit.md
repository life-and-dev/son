# The Holy Spirit

Growing up in church, I was taught the Trinity doctrine—that the Holy Spirit is a distinct divine person, co-equal with the Father and the Son. This teaching left me deeply confused about how to relate to this third person. Should I worship the Holy Spirit directly? Should I pray to Him? How do I balance my worship between the Holy Spirit, the Father, and Jesus? Or are these all the same person with different names? These questions troubled me because if the Holy Spirit truly is a separate person, I needed to know how to properly honor Him.

## Facts about the Holy Spirit

### There can only be 1 Holy Spirit

Paul understood there are only one Holy Spirit:

> * Now there are varieties of gifts, but the *same* Spirit
> * and there are varieties of service, but the *same* Lord;
> * and there are varieties of activities, but it is the *same* God who empowers them all in everyone.
>
> -- 1 Corinthians 12:4-6 (ESV)

> For in **one** Spirit we were all baptized into one body (Jews or Greeks, slaves or free) and all were made to drink of **one** Spirit. -- 1 Corinthians 12:13 (ESV)

> There is
> * one body and **one Spirit** (just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call)
> * one [Lord](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/christ),
> * one [faith](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/saved/belief),
> * one [baptism](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/saved/baptize),
> * one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.
>
> -- Ephesians 4:4-6 (ESV)

> For through him *(Christ)* we both have access in **one Spirit** to the Father. -- Ephesians 2:18 (ESV)

## Was active before Jesus ascended

### In Noah's days

> And the LORD said, “**My Spirit** shall not strive with man forever, for he is indeed flesh; yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.” -- Genesis 6:3 (NKJV)

### In Moses' days

> Where is **He who put His Holy Spirit** within them, Who led them by the right hand of Moses, with His glorious arm, dividing the water before them to make for Himself an everlasting name, Who led them through the deep, as a horse in the wilderness, that they might not stumble? -- Isaiah 63:11-13 (NKJV)

### In David's days

> And as Jesus taught in the temple, he said, “How can the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David? **David himself, in the Holy Spirit**, declared, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet.”’ ” -- Mark 12:35-36 (ESV)

### In Daniel's days

> But at last Daniel came before me (his name is Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god; in him is **the Spirit of the Holy God**), and I told the dream before him, saying: “Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, because I know that **the Spirit of the Holy God** is in you, and no secret troubles you, explain to me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and its interpretation. Daniel 4:8-9 (NKJV)

> “This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen. Now you, Belteshazzar, declare its interpretation, since all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation; but you are able, for **the Spirit of the Holy God** is in you.” -- Daniel 4:18 (NKJV)

### In Zechariah's days

> And his father Zechariah was **filled with the Holy Spirit** and prophesied, saying, “Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for He has visited and redeemed His people.” -- Luke 1:67-68 (ESV)

### While Jesus was on Earth

> When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying,  
> "Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?"  
> So they said, "Some say John the Baptist, some Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."  
> He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"  
> Simon Peter answered and said, "You are [the Christ](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/christ), the Son of the living God."  
> Jesus answered and said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for **flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven**. And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
>
> -- Matthew 16:13-19 (NKJV)"

## What the Holy Spirit is not

### The Holy Spirit cannot be an impersonal power

Power cannot "fellowship":

> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and **the fellowship** of the Holy Spirit be with you all. -- 2 Corinthians 13:14 (ESV)

The Holy Spirit has a personality (Acts 5:3)
* mind (1 Corinthians 2:10)
* will (1 Corinthians 12:4-7)

### The Holy Spirit cannot be a unity of believers

> I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, **eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit** in the bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit — **just as you were called to the one** hope that belongs to your call. -- Ephesians 4:1-4 (ESV)

In other words, "one spirit" could mean a unity of members performing as "one". This is because in the same sentence it also refer to "one body" which Paul (who also wrote Ephesians) explains:

> For as in **one body we have many members**, and the members do not all have the same function, so we, **though many, are one body** in Christ, and individually members one of another. -- Romans 12:4-5 (ESV)

> Because there is one bread, **we who are many are one body**, for we all partake of the one bread. -- 1 Corinthians 10:17 (ESV)

However, Paul more likely meant "unity of the Spirit" as the "united one body" is in unity with God's one (single) Spirit. None of the scriptures supports the concept that we are members of one spirit. Except:

The believers (even when united) cannot:
* Create life (Job 33:4)
* Be the Son of God's father (Matthew 1:18)
* Proceed from the Father, if it should actually be from the believers (John 15:26; Luke 24:49)
* Talk on behalf of God (Hebrews 3:7-12)

### The Holy Spirit cannot be an angel

> And he said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you *(plural)*, **you will see heaven opened, and the angels** of God ascending and **descending on the Son of Man**.” -- John 1:51 (ESV)

vs

> And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, **the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him**. -- Matthew 3:16 (ESV)

> Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, **the heavens were opened, and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form, like a dove**. -- Luke 3:21-22 (ESV)

Just because the Holy Spirit could appear like an angel or "dove", does not mean he is an angel and that these scriptures refers to the same event.

The Holy Spirit is omnipresent:

> Where shall I go from **your Spirit**?
>
> Or where shall I flee from your presence?  
> If I ascend to heaven, you are there!  
> If I make my bed in Sheol, you are there!  
> If I take the wings of the morning dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there your hand shall lead me, and your right hand shall hold me.  
> If I say, "Surely the darkness shall cover me, and the light about me be night," even the darkness is not dark to you; the night is bright as the day, for darkness is as light with you.
>
> -- Psalm 139:7-12 (ESV)

But the angels are not omnipresent:

> Then he said to me, "Fear not, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand and humbled yourself before your God, your words have been heard, and I have come because of your words. The prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days, but Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I was left there with the kings of Persia, and came to make you understand what is to happen to your people in the latter days. -- Daniel 10:12-14 (ESV)

### The Holy Spirit cannot be a separate agent of God

> When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found **to be with child from the Holy Spirit**. -- Matthew 1:18 (ESV)

If the Holy Spirit is an agent of God separate from the Father, several questions arise:
* Would this mean Jesus is the "Son of the Holy Spirit" rather than the "Son of God"? The Gospels consistently identify Jesus as God's Son (Matthew 3:16-17 (ESV); Luke 3:21; John 1:51).
* Why didn't Jesus address or prayer to the Holy Spirit directly? Throughout the Gospels, Jesus prays exclusively to "the Father" and teaches His disciples to do likewise (Matthew 6:9, John 17).

> Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. -- 2 Corinthians 3:17 (ESV)

Although the English translation is unclear which "Lord" Paul was referring to, what is clear is that the Spirit is not a separate entity on its own.

### The Holy Spirit cannot be Jesus himself

The view that Jesus and the Spirit are the same has been labeled 'Modalism' or 'Sabellianism' by church historians. However, we should evaluate this claim based on Scripture.

#### Could the Holy Spirit be Jesus himself?

##### Both know the Father

> All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, and **no one knows the Father except the Son** and anyone to whom **the Son chooses to reveal Him**. -- Matthew 11:27 (ESV)

vs

> ... these things God has revealed to us through **the Spirit**. For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God. For who knows a person’s thoughts except the spirit of that person, which is in him? So also **no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God**. Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but **the Spirit who is from God**, that we might understand the things freely given us by God. -- 1 Corinthians 2:10-11 (ESV)

A possible explanations is that the Spirit is God's Spirit who is part of Himself. Obviously God knows Himself and His own thoughts.

However, the Son also knows God because the Spirit reveals God's will to Him.

##### Both guard against "the desires of the flesh"

> But **put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires**. -- Romans 13:14 (ESV);

> For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have **put on Christ**. -- Galatians 3:27 (ESV)

vs

> But I say, **walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh**. -- Galatians 5:16 (ESV)

Paul used metaphors for example:

> The night is far gone; the day is at hand. So then **let us cast off the works of darkness** and **put on the armor of light**. -- Romans 13:12 (ESV)

> **The Scripture imprisoned** everything under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. -- Galatians 3:22 (ESV)

> For as many of you as were **baptized into Christ** have **put on Christ**. -- Galatians 3:27 (ESV)

The "[armor](https://eternal.family.net.za/life/armor)" is the teachings, examples and the testimony also known as the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Sometimes Paul uses the "armor of God" interchangeably as the "armor of light" or simply just "Christ", meaning the teachings of the Christ that protect us like armor against doubt, confusion, guilt and so forth. In these contexts the teachings of Christ is the motivation for believers to avoid sin described as "the desires of the flesh". 

So to "put on Christ" means to "put on the armor of Christ" which means base your actions, beliefs and hope on the teachings of Christ.

##### Both lead believers in spirit

The term "[Spirit of Jesus](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/spirit)" or "[Spirit of Christ](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/spirit)" is used interchangeably as the "Holy Spirit" in many scriptures like Acts 16:7, Romans 8:1-27, Galatians 4:6, Philippians 1:19, 1 Peter 1:10-11.  

Note that the authors always wrote "the Spirit of Jesus" or "the Spirit of Christ" and never "Jesus' Spirit". "The Spirit of Jesus" could mean the same Spirit that previously enabled and lead Jesus or the Spirit that Jesus gave to his disciples.  This explains why the disciples could do the same miracles as Jesus.

#### Jesus would not send his own spirit to himself or anoint himself

In Luke 4:17 (NKJV) we read:

> And he *(Jesus)* was handed the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written:

Then Jesus quote Isaiah 61:1-2 which are incorrectly quoted in many modern English bibles. A more accurate quote directly from the book of Isaiah 61:1-2 itself reads:

> “The Spirit of **the Lord God** is upon me, because the **LORD** (YHVH) has anointed me to preach good tidings to the poor; He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound; To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.”

> Then he *(Jesus)* closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of all who were in the synagogue were fixed on Him. And He began to say to them, “Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.” -- Luke 4:17-21 (NKJV)

Here Jesus himself announced that this prophecy had been fulfilled in their presence which means that Isaiah 61 was talking about Jesus.

If Jesus was the "Lord God" or "YHVH" of the Old Testament, then **why would Jesus have to send his own spirit to himself and why would Jesus anoint himself to preach, heal and proclaim**?

#### The Holy Spirit cannot be taught

> Who has measured the Spirit of the LORD, or **what man shows Him His counsel**? -- Isaiah 40:13 (ESV)

vs

> And **Jesus increased in wisdom** and in stature and in favor with God and man. -- Luke 2:52 (ESV)

#### The Holy Spirit led Jesus

> And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness for forty days, being tempted by the devil. -- Luke 4:1-2 (ESV); Matthew 4:1; Mark 1:12

Why would Jesus lead himself?

#### The Holy Spirit was active while Jesus was on Earth

> No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, **God abides in us** and His love is perfected in us. By this we know that **we abide in Him and He in us**, because He has given us of **His Spirit**. And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent His Son to be the Savior of the world. Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, **God abides in him, and he in God**. So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and **whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him**. -- 1 John 4:12-16 (ESV)

> When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying,  
> "Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?"  
> So they said, "Some say John the Baptist, some Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."  
> He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"  
> Simon Peter answered and said, "You are [the Christ](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/christ), the Son of the living God."  
> Jesus answered and said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for **flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven**. And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
>
> -- Matthew 16:13-19 (NKJV)"

This implies that the Father's spirit was already active in Peter before Jesus ascended.

#### There are different consequences to speak against them

> And whoever speaks a word against **the Son of Man will be forgiven**,   
> but whoever speaks against **the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven**, either in this age or in the age to come. -- Matthew 12:32; Mark 3:29 (ESV)

#### Jesus did not raise himself from the dead

> If **the Spirit of Him** who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, **He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead** will also give life to your mortal bodies through **His Spirit** who dwells in you. -- Romans 8:11 (ESV)

#### Jesus is with the Father

> In my Father’s house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that **I go** to prepare a place for you? And if **I go** and prepare a place for you, **I will come** again and will take you to myself, that **where I am you may be also**. And you know the way to where **I am going**. -- John 14:2-4 (ESV)

> “I have said these things to you in figures of speech. The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech but will tell you plainly about the Father. In that day you will ask in my name, and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father on your behalf; for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God. I came from the Father and have come into the world, and **now I am leaving the world and going to the Father**.” -- John 16:25-28 (ESV)

#### Jesus is referred separately from the Holy Spirit

##### By Jesus himself

> Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it. If you love me, you will keep my commandments.
>
> And I will ask the Father, and he will give you **another** Helper, to be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you.
>
> -- John 14:13-17 (ESV)

Jesus states here that the Holy Spirit is another Helper and not himself.

##### By Isaiah

> Behold my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights; I have put **My Spirit upon him**; he will bring forth justice to the nations -- Isaiah 42:1 (ESV)

> I will mention the lovingkindnesses of ***the LORD*** *([YHVH](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/father/name#YHVH))* and the praises of ***the LORD***, according to all that ***the LORD*** has bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which He has bestowed on them according to His mercies, according to the multitude of His lovingkindnesses.
> 
> For He said, “Surely they are My people, Children who will not lie.”
> 
> So He became their Savior. In all their affliction He was afflicted, and the Angel of His Presence saved them. In His love and in His pity He redeemed them; And He bore them and carried them. All the days of old. 
> 
> But they rebelled and grieved **His Holy Spirit**;
> 
> So He turned Himself against them as an enemy, and He fought against them. 
>
> Then he remembered the days of old, Moses and his people, saying: 
> 
> “Where is **He who brought them up out of the sea** with the shepherd of His flock?
> Where is **He who put His Holy Spirit** within them, **Who led them** by the right hand of Moses, with His glorious arm, **dividing the water before them** to make for Himself an everlasting name, **Who led them through the deep**, as a horse in the wilderness, that they might not stumble?”
> 
> As a beast goes down into the valley, and **the Spirit of the LORD** *([YHVH](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/father/name#YHVH))* causes him to rest, so You lead Your people, to make Yourself a glorious name. 
> 
> -- Isaiah 63:7-14 (NKJV)

Here Isaiah says the LORD (YHVH) "brought them out of the sea" and in the next sentence "His Holy Spirit" led them through the sea which implies that the Holy Spirit is the part of the LORD's that interact with His creation.

##### By Paul

> I do not cease to give thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers, **that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ**, the Father of glory, may **give you the Spirit** of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him. -- Ephesians 1:16-17 (ESV)

> I appeal to you, brothers, **by our Lord Jesus Christ** and **by the love of the Spirit**... -- Romans 15:30 (ESV)

> **The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ** and **the love of God** and **the fellowship of the Holy Spirit** be with you all. -- 2 Corinthians 13:14

#### The Holy Spirit is good

Jesus said:

> "Why do you call me good? **No one is good except God alone**." -- Mark 10:18 (ESV)

Jesus could possibly have referred to scriptures like Psalm 118:

> Oh, give thanks to the LORD *([YHVH](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/father/name))*, for He is good!
> For His mercy endures forever. -- Psalm 118:1

However, King David also wrote:

> Let your **good Spirit** lead me on level ground! -- Psalm 143:10 (ESV)

And Nehemiah wrote:

> You gave your **good Spirit** to instruct them... -- Nehemiah 9:20

## The Holy Spirit is God

### How God introduce His Spirit

> * ...
> * And that I am the LORD your God, and none else,
> * And my people shall never be ashamed,
> * And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out **My Spirit** upon all flesh;
    >   * And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,
    >   * Your old men shall dream dreams,
    >   * Your young men shall see visions.
> * And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out **My Spirit**.
> * ...
>
> -- Joel 2:27-29 (KJV), Acts 2:17

### The Holy Spirit is the source of life

Both God, the LORD and the Spirit of God created and gave life:

> Thus says God, the LORD, Who created the heavens and stretched them out, Who spread out the earth and what comes from it, **Who gives breath to the people on it and spirit to those who walk in it**... -- Isaiah 42:5 (ESV)

> **The Spirit of God** has made me, and the breath *(spirit)* of the Almighty **gives me life**. -- Job 33:4 (ESV)

### The Holy Spirit made Mary pregnant

If the Holy Spirit was anyone or anything else, then Jesus' father would not be the LORD God.

> When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found **to be with child from the Holy Spirit**. -- Matthew 1:18 (ESV)

> And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall **overshadow** thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. -- Luke 1:35

### God put His Spirit on Jesus

> Yet He warned them not to make him known, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:
> 
>> "Behold! My Servant whom I have chosen,
>> My Beloved in whom My soul is well pleased!
>> **I will put My Spirit upon him**"
>> 
>> -- Isaiah 42:1
> 
> -- Matthew 12:16-18 (NKJV)

### Jesus taught the Holy Spirit comes from the Father

> These twelve Jesus sent out, instructing them... For it is not you who speak, but **the Spirit of your Father** speaking through you. -- Matthew 10:5,20 (ESV)

> “But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you **from the Father**, the Spirit of truth, **who proceeds from the Father** *[(originates from the Father)](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/john/15-26.htm)*, he will bear witness about me. -- John 15:26 (ESV)

> And behold, I am sending **the promise of my Father** upon you. -- Luke 24:49

### Peter implied the Holy Spirit is God

> But Peter said, “Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land? While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? Why is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to man but to God.” -- Acts 5:3-4 (ESV)

### The Holy Spirit talks on behalf of God

> Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says,
>
> “Today, **if you hear his voice**, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, on the day of testing in the wilderness, where your fathers put me to the test and saw my works for forty years. Therefore **I** was provoked with that generation, and said, ‘They always go astray in their heart; they have not known my ways.’ As I swore in my wrath, ‘They shall not enter **my** rest.’ ” (Psalm 95:7-11)
>
> Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from **the living God**.
>
> -- Hebrews 3:7-12 (ESV)

### Only the one's spirit knows one

> For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God. For who knows a person’s thoughts except the spirit of that person, which is in him? So also **no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God**.
>
> Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but **the Spirit who is from God**, that we might understand the things freely given us by God. And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual. The natural person does not accept the things of **the Spirit of God**, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned.
>
> The spiritual person judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one.
>
> “For who has understood the **mind of the LORD** *(Isaiah 40:13)* so as to instruct him?”
>
> -- 1 Corinthians 2:11-16 (ESV)

### Both God and the Holy Spirit is our comforters

> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and **God of all comfort, Who comforts us** in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which **we ourselves are comforted by God**. -- 2 Corinthians 1:3-4 (KJV)

and

> And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another **Comforter**, that he may abide with you for ever.
> 
> ...
> 
> But **the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send** in my name, He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.
> 
> -- John 14:16,26 (KJV)

### Paul implies that the LORD (YHVH) is the Spirit

> Yes, to this day whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their hearts. But when one turns to the LORD (Deuteronomy 30:10; Psalm 22:27), the veil is removed.
>
> Now **the Lord is the Spirit**, and where **the Spirit of the Lord is**, there is freedom. And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from **the Lord who is the Spirit**. -- 2 Corinthians 3:15-18

### John implies that the Spirit is God

> For there are three that **testify**: 
> * **the Spirit** and 
> * the water and 
> * the blood; 
> 
> and these three agree. If we receive the testimony of men, **the testimony of God** is greater.
> 
> -- 1 John 5:7-9 (ESV)

God is not water or blood, so this implies that the Spirit is God.

### Raised Jesus from the dead

Paul stated that it was God the Father, who raised Jesus from the dead:

> Paul, an apostle - not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and **God the Father, who raised him from the dead**... -- Galatians 1:1 (ESV)

Peter stated that it was the Holy Spirit, who raised Jesus from the dead:

> For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but **made alive in the Spirit** -- 1 Peter 3:18 (ESV)

Unless the apostles contradict each other, it would mean that the Spirit is God the Father's Spirit.

### Jesus received the authority to send the Holy Spirit on his behalf

> Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, **I will send him** to you. And when he comes, he will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment:
> 
> * concerning sin, because they do not believe in me; 
> * concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no longer; 
> * concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged. 
>  
> I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for **he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak**, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you. **All that the Father has is mine**; therefore I said that **he will take what is mine and declare it to you**. -- John 16:7-15 (ESV)

> You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact **the Spirit of God** dwells in you. Anyone who does not have **the Spirit of Christ** does not belong to him. But if **Christ is in** you, although the body is dead because of sin, the **Spirit is life** because of righteousness. -- Romans 8:9-10 (ESV)

This may explain why the Spirit behave and acts like Jesus and is also referred to as "the mind of Christ" or "the Spirit of Christ".

However, this brings up an interesting conundrum: Who is under whose authority?

#### Fellowship of the Holy Spirit

> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship **of** the Holy Spirit be with you all. -- 2 Corinthians 13:14 (ESV)

It might be no coincidence that Paul named God's love and the Holy Spirit's fellowship next to each other. God love the believers, however because we do not have direct access to God, we cannot directly have fellowship with God. Therefore, we need God's Spirit to fellowship with Him. Note that it is fellowship **of** the Holy Spirit and not fellowship **with** the Holy Spirit.

According to Jesus we ought to enjoy fellowship **with** both the Father and His Son.

> That which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you, so that you too may have **fellowship with us**; and indeed **our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ**. -- 1 John 1:3

Note that Jesus did not mention the Holy Spirit in his prayer, because our fellowship is **with** the Father and the Son. Unlike Paul, Jesus was praying to his Father, who already understood how the fellowship will be possible, so it was not necessary for Jesus to mention that this "fellowship" will become possible "of" the Holy Spirit.

## What This Means for You

Now that you've explored the biblical evidence, you face a personal question: 

How will this understanding of the Holy Spirit change your relationship with God? 

When you pray, remember that God's Spirit dwells within you and that God's Spirit is not a separate entity to petition, but as the very presence of your Heavenly Father guiding your thoughts and interceding on your behalf. When you read Scripture and feel convicted, that's the Father Himself speaking through His Spirit. When you experience comfort in trials, that's God Himself drawing near through the same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead.

The question isn't whether you should "build a relationship" with the Holy Spirit separately from the Father, but instead, ask yourself: Am I sensitive to the Father's Spirit moving in my life?
