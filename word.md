# The Word with God

I was taught that "the Word" is another name for Jesus. That Jesus existed as "the Word" before he was born. That John 1:1 proves Jesus is God himself.

But something didn't sit right. If "the Word" is Jesus, why does John 1:1 say "the Word was with God" AND "the Word was God"? How can Jesus be with God and be God at the same time? Why did John never use "the Word" to refer to Jesus anywhere else in his gospel? And if Jesus is God, why did John write "no one has seen God" after describing how people saw and touched Jesus?

I started digging deeper. I looked at how the Greek word "logos" is actually used in Scripture. I examined how the apostles understood "the Word of God." I traced John's usage throughout his gospel. What I discovered challenged everything I had been taught.

This article shares what I found. I'll present the evidence objectively. The linguistic data, the biblical usage patterns, the verse by verse analysis of John 1. Then readers can decide for themselves whether "the Word" is Jesus himself or something else entirely.

If this confusion sounds familiar, keep reading. The solution may be simpler than expected.

## The Meaning of "The Word"

Before examining John 1, we need to understand what the Greek word "logos" (translated as "the Word") actually means.

"Logos" has a **very wide range of meanings** that fall into two basic categories:

1. **The mind and its products**: reason, logic (English "logic" comes from "logos")
2. **Expression of that reason**: word, saying, command, plan, promise

The Bible itself demonstrates this wide range. "Logos" appears over 300 times in the Greek New Testament, but is only translated as "word" about 175 times in the King James Version and 125 times in the NIV. The same Greek word is also translated as:

account, appearance, book, command, conversation, eloquence, flattery, grievance, instruction, matter, message, ministry, news, proposal, question, reason, reply, report, rule, rumor, saying, sentence, speech, story, teaching, testimony, truth, and more.

**This matters**: Whichever meaning we assign to "the word" in John 1 drastically changes the message.

### "The Word" According to Strong's Concordance

### "The Word" According to the BDAG Greek-English Lexicon

The BDAG lexicon (the standard scholarly Greek-English dictionary) shows how "logos" is translated in various New Testament passages:

| Translation | Scripture Example                                        |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| account     | Matthew 12:36 - "give account on Judgment Day"           |
| question    | Matthew 21:24 - "I will ask you one question"            |
| message     | Luke 4:32 - "his message had authority"                  |
| statement   | Luke 20:20 - "catch him in some statement"               |
| saying      | John 4:37 - "thus the saying, 'One sows, another reaps'" |
| teaching    | John 6:60 - "this is a hard teaching"                    |
| reason      | Acts 10:29 - "for what reason you sent for me"           |
| matter      | Acts 15:6 - "came together to look into this matter"     |
| command     | Galatians 5:14 - "summed up in a single command"         |
| preaching   | 1 Timothy 5:17 - "those whose work is preaching"         |
| said        | Romans 15:18 - "what I have said"                        |

***"Logos" is NOT typically used to designate a person, but rather ideas, statements, plans, commands, or messages.***

## How Other Apostles Define "The Word of God"

John was not the only apostle who testified about Jesus fulfilling "the Word of God." Let's see how Peter, Stephen, and Paul described the same concept.

### Peter: "The Word" as God's Definite Plan

> Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, **a man** [attested](https://biblehub.com/greek/584.htm) to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that **God did through him** in your midst, as you yourselves know — this Jesus, delivered up according to **the definite plan and foreknowledge of God**, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men. **God raised him up**, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it. — Acts 2:22-24 (ESV)

Peter identifies "the Word of God" as **God's definite plan and foreknowledge**. Jesus was:

- A man whom God worked through
- Delivered according to God's plan
- Raised by God

### Stephen: "The Word" as God's Promise

> "Brothers and fathers, hear me. **The God of glory** appeared to our father Abraham... Yet He gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot's length, but **promised** to give it to him as a possession and to his offspring after him, though he had no child. And **God spoke** to this effect... But as the time of **the promise** drew near, which God had granted to Abraham...
>
> You stiff-necked people... Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those **who announced** beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered...
>
> But he, full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. And he said, "Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son **of Man** standing at the right hand of God."
>
> — Acts 7:2,6,51-53,55-56 (ESV)

Stephen identifies "the Word of God" as **God's promise** announced by prophets and fulfilled in Jesus, the Righteous One.

### Paul: "The Word" as God's Promise Fulfilled

> So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said: "Men of Israel and you who fear God, listen. The God of this people Israel chose our fathers... Of **this man's** offspring **God** has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, **as He promised**. Before his coming, John had proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. And as John was finishing his course, he said, 'What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but behold, after me one is coming, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.'
>
> "Brothers, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to us has been sent **the message of this salvation**... And we bring you the good news that **what God promised** to the fathers, this he **has fulfilled** to us their children by raising Jesus....
>
> Let it be known to you therefore, brothers, that through this **man** forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, and by him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses."
>
> — Acts 13:16-17,23-26,32,38-39 (ESV)

Paul also writes to Titus:

> Paul, a bondservant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect and the acknowledgment of the truth which accords with godliness, in hope of **eternal life** which **God, who cannot lie, promised before time began**, but has in due time **manifested** [(made clear/visible/known)](https://biblehub.com/greek/5319.htm) **His word** through preaching, which was committed to me according to the commandment of **God our Savior**. — Titus 1:1-3 (NKJV)

Paul identifies "the Word of God" as **God's promise** that was fulfilled when God raised Jesus and made salvation available.

### Peter (2 Peter): "The Word" as God's Promise About Creation and Future

> For they deliberately overlook this fact, that the heavens existed long ago, and the earth was formed out of water and through water **by the word of God**, and that by means of these the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished. But **by the same word** the heavens and earth that now exist are stored up for fire, being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly. But do not overlook this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slow to **fulfill His promise** as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.
>
> But [the day of the Lord](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/death.md#day-of-the-lord) will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the heavenly bodies will be burned up and dissolved, and the earth and the works that are done on it will be exposed. Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, what sort of people ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness, waiting for and hastening the coming of [the day of God](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/death.md#day-of-the-lord), because of which the heavens will be set on fire and dissolved, and the heavenly bodies will melt as they burn!
>
> But according to **His promise** we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.
>
> — 2 Peter 3:5-13 (ESV)

Peter uses "the word of God" and "His promise" interchangeably. The same word that created the heavens and earth (God's command) is the same promise that will bring future judgment and new creation.

### Apostolic Consensus

| Apostle          | Definition of "The Word of God"                     |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Peter (Acts)     | The definite plan and foreknowledge of God          |
| Stephen          | God's promise announced by prophets                 |
| Paul             | God's promise fulfilled in Jesus                    |
| Peter (2 Peter)  | God's promise (creation and future)                 |

Notice the pattern: The early apostles **consistently** understood "the Word of God" as God's plan or promise about salvation through Jesus, not as Jesus himself being a pre-existent divine "Word" entity.

## How John Uses "The Word" in His Gospel

Having seen how the other apostles consistently used "the Word of God" to mean God's plan or promise, let's examine whether John's usage aligns with theirs.

If John intended "the Word" in John 1 to mean "Jesus," we would expect him to use "the word" ([ho logos](https://biblehub.com/greek/3056.htm)) consistently as a title for Jesus throughout his gospel. Let's examine how John actually uses this exact Greek phrase:

### John Uses "The Word" for Sayings and Teachings

>  For here **the saying** ([ho logos](https://biblehub.com/greek/3056.htm)) holds true, 'One sows and another reaps.' — John 4:37 (ESV)

> When many of his disciples heard it, they said, "This is a hard **saying** ([ho logos](https://biblehub.com/greek/3056.htm)); who can listen to it?" — John 6:60 (ESV)

> Jesus answered them "...you seek to kill me because **my word** ([ho logos](https://biblehub.com/greek/3056.htm)) finds no place in you." — John 8:37 (ESV)

> But **the word** ([ho logos](https://biblehub.com/greek/3056.htm)) that is written in their Law must be fulfilled. — John 15:25 (ESV)

### John Uses "The Word" for Prophecies

> Though he *(Jesus)* had done so many signs before them, they still did not believe in him, so that **the word** ([ho logos](https://biblehub.com/greek/3056.htm)) spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:
>
> "Lord, who has believed what he heard from us, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?" (Isaiah 53:1)
>
> — John 12:37-38 (ESV)

> This was to fulfill **the word** ([ho logos](https://biblehub.com/greek/3056.htm)) that he had spoken. — John 18:9 (ESV)

> This was to fulfill **the word** ([ho logos](https://biblehub.com/greek/3056.htm)) that Jesus had spoken to show by what kind of death he was going to die. — John 18:32 (ESV)

### John Uses "The Word" for God's Message and Truth

> Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your Law, 'I said, you are gods'? If he called them gods to whom **the word of God** ([ho logos](https://biblehub.com/greek/3056.htm)) came — and Scripture cannot be broken — do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, 'You are [blaspheming](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/blasphemy.md),' because I said, '[I am the Son of God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-god.md)'? — John 10:34-36 (ESV)

> And Jesus cried out and said, "Whoever believes in me, believes not in me but in Him who sent me. And whoever sees me sees Him Who sent me. I have come into the world as light, so that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness. If anyone hears **my words** and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world. The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has a Judge; **the word** ([ho logos](https://biblehub.com/greek/3056.htm)) that I have spoken will judge him on the last day. For I have not spoken on my own authority, but the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment — what to say and what to speak." — John 12:44-50 (ESV)

> Jesus spoke these words, lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, "Father... I have given them **Your word** ([logon](https://biblehub.com/greek/3056.htm)); and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world... Sanctify them by Your truth. **Your word** ([ho logos](https://biblehub.com/greek/3056.htm)) is truth. — John 17:14-17 (NKJV)

### How John Defines "The Word"

| Meaning of "word"                 | Scripture                                                                                                    |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Jesus's spoken word/teaching      | John 2:22; 4:39,41,50; 5:24,38; 8:31,37,43,51,52,55; 10:34-48; 12:44-50; 14:23,24; 15:3,20,25; 17:6,14,17,20 |
| saying/proverb                    | John 4:37; 6:60; 7:36,40                                                                                     |
| God's word/Scripture              | John 10:35; 17:17                                                                                            |
| prophecy fulfilled                | John 12:38,48; 15:25; 18:9,32; 19:8                                                                          |
| division/disagreement about Jesus | John 10:19; 19:13; 21:23                                                                                     |

John **NEVER** uses "the word" ([ho logos](https://biblehub.com/greek/3056.htm)) to directly refer to Jesus as a person. Instead, John consistently distinguishes between:

- **Jesus** (the person)
- **The word** (Jesus's teachings, prophecies about him, or God's truth)

For example:

> When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and **the word** ([logō](https://biblehub.com/greek/3056.htm)) that Jesus had spoken. — John 2:22 (ESV)

> Many Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, "He told me all that I ever did." So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days. And many more believed because of **his word** ([logon](https://biblehub.com/greek/3056.htm)). — John 4:39-41 (ESV)

> Jesus said to him, "Go; your son will live." The man believed **the word** ([logō](https://biblehub.com/greek/3056.htm)) that Jesus spoke to him and went on his way. — John 4:50 (ESV)

> So Jesus said to them... "Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears **my word** ([logon](https://biblehub.com/greek/3056.htm)) and believes him who sent me has eternal life." — John 5:24 (ESV)

> His voice you have never heard, this form you have never seen, and you do not have **His word** ([logon](https://biblehub.com/greek/3056.htm)) abiding in you, for you do not believe the one whom He has sent. — John 5:38 (ESV)

> So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him, "If you abide in **my word** ([logō](https://biblehub.com/greek/3056.htm)), you are truly my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free." — John 8:31 (ESV)

> Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and I am here. I came not of my own accord, but he sent me. Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to hear **my word** ([logon](https://biblehub.com/greek/3056.htm))." — John 8:42-43 (ESV)

> Jesus answered, "I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me. Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it, and He is the judge. Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps **my word** ([logon](https://biblehub.com/greek/3056.htm)), he will never see death."<br/>
> The Jews said to him, "Now we know that you have a demon! Abraham died, as did the prophets, yet you say, 'If anyone keeps **my word** ([logon](https://biblehub.com/greek/3056.htm)), he will never taste death.' Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets died! Who do you make yourself out to be?"<br/>
> Jesus answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father Who glorifies me, of Whom you say, 'He is our God.' But you have not known Him. I know Him. If I were to say that I do not know Him, I would be a liar like you, but I do know Him and I keep **His word** ([logon](https://biblehub.com/greek/3056.htm)).
>
> — John 8:49-55 (ESV)

> "I do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in me through **their word** ([logou](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/john/17-20.htm)), that they may all be one, just as You, Father, are in me, and I in You, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that You have sent me." — John 17:20-21 (ESV)

Notice: **Jesus** spoke **the word**. The disciples believed **the word** that **Jesus** spoke. These are distinct concepts.

### John's Usage Aligns with Other Apostles

Based on John's consistent usage throughout his gospel, "the Word" is **not a person**, but rather:

- God's plan, promise, or purpose
- Teachings and prophecies
- God's truth revealed through Scripture

This understanding perfectly aligns with:
- Strong's Concordance and standard Greek lexicons
- How Peter, Stephen, and Paul used "the Word of God"
- John's stated purpose: to testify that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God

With this foundation established, we can now examine John 1 with proper context.

## The Overall Message of John 1

Some claim John wrote:

- A mysterious riddle ("Guess what 'the word' is!")
- Purely symbolic or poetic text (doesn't need to make literal sense)
- A complex theological puzzle requiring years of study to understand

But John himself explains his purpose:

> This is the disciple *(John)* who is bearing **witness** about these things, and who has written these things, and we know that **his testimony** is true. — John 21:24 (ESV)

A witness or testimony should be **clear and understandable**, not overcomplicated, confusing, or mysterious.

John explicitly states his goal:

> These are written so that you may believe that
>
> - [Jesus is the Christ](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/christ.md),
> - [the Son of God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/of-god.md), and
> - that [by believing](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/saved/belief.md) [you may have life](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/saved.md) in his [name](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/name.md).
>
> — John 20:31 (ESV)

John wants readers to believe Jesus is the Christ (Messiah) and the Son of God. NOT that Jesus is God himself or a pre-existent divine "Word" entity.

John's gospel includes multiple witnesses testifying about Jesus:

- John the Baptist: "Behold the Lamb of God" (John 1:29,36)
- John the Baptist: "This is the Son of God" (John 1:34)
- Andrew: "We have found the Messiah" (John 1:41)
- Nathanael: "You are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel" (John 1:49)

**Note**: If John was testifying about the Trinity in chapter 1, why did he fail to mention the Holy Spirit in his introduction?

Let's now examine John 1 verse by verse.

### If "The Word" = Jesus

If we read "the Word" (logos) as "Jesus," John 1 becomes confusing and contradictory:

> In the beginning was *Jesus*, and *Jesus* was with God, and *Jesus* was God. The same *(Jesus)* was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him *(Jesus)*; and without Him *(Jesus)* was not any thing made that was made. In Him *(Jesus)* was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.
>
> There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light *(Jesus)*, that all men through him might believe. He was not that Light *(Jesus)*, but was sent to bear witness of that Light *(Jesus)*. That was the true Light *(Jesus)*, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.
>
> He *(Jesus)* was in the world, and the world was made by Him *(Jesus)*, and the world knew Him *(Jesus)* not. He *(Jesus)* came unto His *(Jesus)* own, and His *(Jesus)* own received Him *(Jesus)* not. But as many as received Him *(Jesus)*, to them gave He *(Jesus)* power to become the sons of God *(Jesus)*, even to them that believe on His name *(Jesus)*: Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God *(Jesus)*. And *Jesus* was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld His *(Jesus)* glory, the glory as of the only begotten of **the Father**) full of grace and truth.
>
> John bare witness of Him *(Jesus)*, and cried, saying,
>
> This was He of Whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for He was before me.
>
> And of His fulness *(Jesus)* have all we received, and grace for grace. For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.
>
> No man hath seen God *(Jesus)* at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, He *(Jesus)* hath declared Him *(Jesus)*.
>
> — John 1 with "Word" replaced by "Jesus"

**Problems with this reading:**

- Jesus was with God AND was God? (Contradiction in v1)
- People saw Jesus, but "no one has seen God"? (Contradiction in v18)
- Jesus created all things, but the Father is the creator? (Inconsistent with rest of Scripture)
- Jesus declared himself? (Makes no sense in v18)
- "Only begotten of the Father" but also IS the Father? (Contradiction in v14)

Even many Trinitarians admit this direct substitution doesn't work. They argue it requires years of theological study to understand the "mystery" of the Trinity.

### If "The Word" = God's Plan

John more likely intended this message (paraphrased with "Word" = God's plan/promise):

> In the beginning, God already had a plan. This plan was for God's benefit and was divine in nature. God used this plan in the beginning to create everything according to it — nothing exists that was not part of God's plan.
>
> This plan includes the solution to life (the gospel of salvation), which is "the light" that shines into "the darkness" (deception), exposing lies.
>
> John the Baptist was sent by God to testify about this "light" (the gospel), so that through his witness all might believe. John was not the light himself, but came to bear witness to it. The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world.
>
> He came to the world that was made through God's plan, yet the world did not know him. He came to his own people, and his own people rejected him. But to those who received him, he gave the right to become children of God — those who believe in his authority, that he was not born of human will, but according to God's plan.
>
> This plan became reality when our savior was born among us. We have seen God's glory — the glory of the Father pleased with his only begotten Son, in whom grace and truth are fully revealed.
>
> John the Baptist testified: "This is the one I spoke about: 'He who comes after me ranks above me, because he was before me [in status].'"
>
> From his fullness we have all received grace upon grace. The law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
>
> Although no one has ever seen (fully understood) God, the only begotten Son, who is intimately close to the Father, has made him known.
>
> — John 1 (Paraphrased with "Word" = Plan/Promise)

This interpretation aligns with Paul's summary:

> The gospel of God, which He **promised** beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh... — Romans 1:1-3 (ESV)

## Analyzing John 1

### John 1:1 - In the Beginning Was the Word

#### Key Observations

1. **John uses the definite article three times**: "THE Word" (HO LOGOS) - He's referring to a specific word, not just any word

2. **"Logos" has many possible meanings** - We've already seen it can mean plan, promise, command, teaching, prophecy (see [What Does "The Word" Mean?](#what-does-the-word-logos-mean))

3. **John refers to God twice in different grammatical forms**:
   - "WITH God" (PROS THEON) - with preposition + accusative case
   - "God" (THEOS) - without article + nominative case

#### Translation Controversies

**Jehovah's Witness interpretation:**

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with **the God**, and the Word was **a god**.

This reading suggests two different gods, which contradicts monotheism.

**New English Bible:**

> What God was, the Word was.

This suggests "the word" shared the same attribute as God (eternal existence from the beginning).

#### The Apparent Paradox

Why did John write both "the Word was with God" AND "the Word was God"?

> The issue of the paradoxical relationship of the Son (or "Word") to the Father is faced immediately.... Here is the seeming contradiction of the Word being God and yet not being God. — Millard J. Erickson (God in Three Persons, p 199)

**The problem**: "X was with Y" implies X ≠ Y, but "X was Y" implies X = Y.

However, as Dr. Dale Tuggy notes:

> If you interpret that the author is contradicting himself in the opening sentence, you probably made a big mistake. The author is probably not stupid. The author should be able to remain consistent in the space of at least one sentence.

#### Resolving the Paradox

The Greek word "theos" can mean:

- **God Almighty** (the Father)
- **Divine** or [a god/important person](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/god.md)

Scholar Murry J. Harris suggests:

> Whenever [theos or ho theos are] found in the New Testament, we are to assume that *ho pater* [the Father] is the referent unless the context makes this sense impossible. — Murry J. Harris (Jesus as God, p 271)

Which reading makes more sense?

1. "The Word was with the Father, and the Word was the Father" ❌ (Contradiction)
2. "The Word was with the Father, and the Word was [divine](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/god.md)" ✅ (Consistent)

#### What Makes "The Word" Divine?

To Jewish readers, "the Word of the LORD" meant God's **command**:

> By **the word of the LORD** the heavens were made, and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth... For He spoke, and it was done; **He commanded**, and it stood fast. — Psalm 33:6,9 (NKJV)

God's plan/command is divine because it originates from God and carries his authority.

#### Understanding "Pros" (With)

The Greek preposition "pros" is translated "with" in most English versions:

> "the Word was **with** God" (pros ton theon)

**This translation works perfectly when "the Word" = God's plan:**

God's plan existed **with God** (in God's mind and purpose) from the beginning. This is exactly how Peter describes it: "the **definite plan and foreknowledge** of God" (Acts 2:23). A plan exists with the one who makes it.

**Additional nuance**: The preposition ["pros"](https://biblehub.com/greek/4314.htm) can carry meanings like:
- "toward" (direction)
- "for the benefit of" (purpose)
- "in the presence of" (proximity)

So "the plan was pros God" could mean:
- The plan was **with** God (standard reading) ✅
- The plan was **for** God's benefit/purpose ✅
- The plan was **in the presence of** God ✅

All three nuances align with understanding "the Word" as God's plan.

#### The "Qualitative Theos" Argument

Some scholars argue that the anarthrous "theos" (without the article) in John 1:1c is **qualitative**, meaning "the Word possesses the nature or quality of deity" rather than being "a god" or merely "divine."

**Response:**

1. **"Qualitative" still means "god-like" or "divine"**: Even if we accept the qualitative reading, it doesn't mean "the Word is God the Father." It means the Word has divine quality or characteristics. This actually **supports** our interpretation. God's plan/word is divine in nature because it originates from God and carries his authority.

2. **The question remains: What has divine quality?**: The debate isn't whether "the Word" is divine, but rather what "the Word" refers to. Is it:
   - A pre-existent divine person (Jesus)? OR
   - God's divine plan/promise/command?

3. **Context determines meaning**: John's consistent use of "logos" throughout his Gospel (teachings, prophecies, sayings - never as a title for Jesus) indicates "the Word" means God's message/plan, not a divine person.

4. **Jewish precedent**: To Jewish readers familiar with the Old Testament, "the word of the LORD" was already understood as divine because it comes from God and accomplishes God's purposes (Isaiah 55:11, Psalm 33:6).

**Conclusion**: Whether we translate "theos" as "divine" or "had the quality of deity," both readings support the same conclusion. God's word/plan is divine because it originates from God, not because "the Word" is a pre-existent divine Jesus.

#### Alternative Reading

> In the beginning was **the plan**, and **the plan** was **with** God, and **the plan** was **divine**.

This reading is:

- **Consistent** (no contradiction - a plan can be with someone and be divine in nature)
- **Aligned with Jewish understanding** of "word" as God's command (Psalm 33:6,9)
- **Supported by apostolic testimony** (Peter, Stephen, Paul all define "the Word" as God's plan - see [How Other Apostles Define "The Word"](#how-other-apostles-define-the-word-of-god))
- **Preserves strict monotheism** (see below)

#### This Reading Preserves Strict Monotheism

The interpretation "the Word = God's plan" is consistent with biblical monotheism, while "the Word = divine Jesus" creates theological difficulties.

**The Shema** (Israel's foundational confession of faith):

> Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is **one**. — Deuteronomy 6:4 (ESV)

Jesus himself affirmed this as the first and greatest commandment:

> Jesus answered, "The most important is, 'Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is **one**. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.'" — Mark 12:29-30 (ESV)

**The problem with "the Word = divine Jesus":**

If "the Word was God" means Jesus is God Almighty, and the Father is God Almighty, then either:
1. Jesus = the Father (contradicts "the Word was with God")
2. Jesus ≠ the Father, but both are God (contradicts "the LORD is one")

**The solution with "the Word = God's plan":**

- God (the Father) is **one**
- God's word/plan is **divine** (because it comes from God)
- No contradiction with monotheism

For detailed discussion of biblical monotheism and the Shema, see [The Shema: Hear O Israel](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/shema)

**Key insight**: Understanding "the Word" as God's divine plan preserves the strict monotheism that Jesus himself affirmed.

### John 1:2 - This Was in the Beginning

> *He* was in the beginning with God. — John 1:2 (ESV)

#### Translation Issue: "He" or "It"?

The Greek word ["houtos"](https://biblehub.com/greek/3778.htm) can mean either "he," "it," or "this," depending on context. Many translators assume "the Word" = Jesus (a person), so they translate "houtos" as "he." This is circular reasoning.

Other translations:

- **KJV/ASV**: "The same was in the beginning with God"
- **NET**: "The Word was with God in the beginning"
- **REV**: "This word was in the beginning with God"

#### Why the Repetition?

Original Greek had no punctuation marks. Verse 2 likely serves as a transition connecting verse 1 (the origin and nature of God's plan) with verse 3 (how God used his plan to create).

This shifts the subject from "the word" (God's plan) back to **God** (the Creator). John is testifying about the God of Israel who created us through His word (Genesis 1, Psalm 33:6, Isaiah 55:11), not promoting Greek philosophical speculation about impersonal cosmic principles ([Stoics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/)) or intermediary beings ([Philo](https://iep.utm.edu/philo/)). John strategically used "Logos" as a bridge term familiar to Greek-educated readers, then transformed it with Jewish scriptural meaning - similar to Paul's approach at Mars Hill (Acts 17:22-34) ([Bible-Researcher](https://www.bible-researcher.com/logos.html)).

### John 1:3 - All Things Were Made Through It

> All things were made ***through Him***, and without Him nothing was made that was made. — John 1:3 (ESV)

or

> All things were made ***by Him***; and without Him was not any thing made that was made. — John 1:3 (KJV)

or

> Everything came to be ***through it***, and apart from it nothing came to be. — John 1:3 (REV)

#### "Through Him" or "Through It"?

Whether "him" (God) or "it" (the word/plan), both readings point to the same truth: **God created according to his word (command/plan)**.

**Old Testament parallel:**

> By **the word of the LORD** the heavens were made, and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth... For **He spoke, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast**. — Psalm 33:6,9 (NKJV)

> Let them praise the name of the LORD, for **He commanded** and they were created. — Psalm 148:5 (NRSV)

In Genesis 1, God created by **speaking**: "Let there be..." and it was created.

**Peter's understanding (2 Peter 3:5-9,13):**

> The heavens existed long ago, and the earth was formed out of water and through water **by the word of God**... by **the same word** the heavens and earth that now exist are stored up for fire... The Lord is not slow to **fulfill His promise**... But **according to His promise** we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth.

Peter equates "the word" with God's **promise**. God created by his word, and will fulfill his future promises by the same word.

**Key insight**: "The word" = God's command/plan, not a pre-existent Jesus.

### John 1:4-5 - In Him Was Life

> In Him was life; and the life was [the light](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/metaphors/light.md) of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. — John 1:4-5 (KJV)

#### Parallels with Genesis 1

> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep... Then God said, "Let there be light"; and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness. — Genesis 1:1-4 (NRSV)

John echoes Genesis: "in the beginning," "light," and "darkness."

#### What Are "The Life" and "The Light"?

John introduces two metaphors:

- **"The life"** = [eternal salvation](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/saved.md)
- **"The light"** = [the gospel/truth](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/metaphors/light.md) that exposes darkness (deception)

These are NOT titles for Jesus himself, but rather describe the **result of God's plan**:

- God's plan includes the solution for eternal life
- This truth shines into a world of darkness (lies/deception)

**Key point**: God did not create Jesus or himself "in the beginning." Rather, God's creation and plan (the word) provided the solution for life and light, which is why John mentions them here.

### John 1:6-9 - John's Witness to the Light

> There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. This man came for a witness, to **bear witness of [the light](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/metaphors/light.md)**, that all through him might believe. He was not that light, but was sent to **bear witness of that light**. That was the true light which gives light to every man coming into the world. — John 1:6-9 (NKJV)

#### Was John the Baptist Testifying About Jesus or the Gospel?

Some translations add words that aren't in the original Greek:

> The *one who is* the true light, *who* gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. — John 1:9 (NLT)

The italicized words create the impression that "the light" = Jesus himself.

However, in context (John 1:4), "the life" = [eternal salvation](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/saved.md), which is also [the Glory of God](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/metaphors/light.md#glory). This is [the purpose why God created life](https://eternal.family.net.za/creation.md#the-purpose-of-creation) (Psalm 86:9-10, 148:1-12; Ephesians 1:3-6).

#### Why Clarify That John the Baptist Was Not the Light?

People easily idolize messengers. John the Apostle makes clear: **Don't idolize John the Baptist**. He was only "bearing witness of the light" (the gospel). He was not:

- The means to salvation ("the life")
- The glory itself ("the light")

The gospel (the light) reveals God's glory and points to salvation, which was coming into the world through Jesus.

### John 1:10-13 - Rejection and Acceptance

> He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. He came unto his own, and his own received him not. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. — John 1:10-13 (KJV)

#### Who Is "He" in This Passage?

- **NOT John the Baptist** - "he was not that light" (John 1:8)
- **God?** - If so, how could God be "born of God" (v13)? This creates a contradiction.
- **Jesus?** - This makes sense, BUT we need to explain "the world was made by him" when God (not Jesus) is the Creator.

#### What Does "The World Was Made By Him" Mean?

Note the order:

1. "He was in the world" (present in it)
2. "The world was made by him" (came after)

If John meant physical creation, this makes no sense:

- Jesus/God couldn't be "in the world" before the world existed
- This would be redundant (already stated in v3)

**Better understanding**: "The world" here = **the people of the world**.

"The world was made by him" likely means:

- Those who accept him are **spiritually reborn** (made into God's children)
- The believing world is "made" through Jesus's work

#### The Authority (Name) to Become Sons of God

"Sons of God" are made when people **believe on his [name](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/name.md) (authority)**, which is:

- Jesus "was born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God"
- Jesus was NOT an accident (Mary's out-of-wedlock affair)
- Jesus was born **according to God's will/plan**

This ties back to "the Word" (God's plan) becoming flesh.

### John 1:14 - The Word Became Flesh

> And **the word became flesh** and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. — John 1:14 (NKJV)

#### Does This Mean Incarnation?

Some claim this proves [Jesus was God incarnate](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/as-god/incarnation.md) - that God became human.

**Alternative understanding**: "The word became flesh" = **God's promised plan materialized** when Jesus was born.

- God's plan/promise ([the word](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/word.md)) became **reality** in human form
- God kept his promise through [the prophets](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/prophecies.md)
- This event [glorified](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/glory.md) God (showed his faithfulness)

"We beheld his glory" = We saw God's glory displayed in the only begotten Son, full of grace and truth.

**Key point**: The Word (plan) becoming flesh doesn't require Jesus to be God. It means God's plan was fulfilled in Jesus's birth.

### John 1:15 - He Was Before Me

> John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, "This was He of whom I said, 'He who comes after me is preferred before me, for He was before me.'" — John 1:15 (NKJV)

> The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, "Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! This is he of whom I said, 'After me comes **a man** who is preferred before me, for he was before me.'" — John 1:29-30 (NKJV)

#### Does "Before Me" Mean Pre-existence?

John the Baptist was older than Jesus, so "he was before me" seems puzzling. Does it mean Jesus [pre-existed](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/as-god/incarnation.md)?

**NO.** The Greek word "protos" (translated "before") can also mean:

- **First in rank** (chief, leader, superior)
- Examples: Matthew 20:27, 22:38; Mark 6:21, 10:44; Luke 11:26

**Better translation**: "He ranks above me" or "He is greater than me."

John the Baptist acknowledged Jesus's superior authority and importance, not that Jesus existed before him chronologically.

### John 1:16-17 - Fullness of Grace

> And of his *[fullness](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/john/1-16.htm)* we have all received, and grace for grace. For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. — John 1:16-17 (NKJV)

#### What Is "Fullness"?

Greek "pléróma" ([Strong's](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/john/1-16.htm)) = fullness, filling up, fulfillment, completion

Scholars interpret this differently:

1. Jesus was "full of God" (supports deity claims) ❌ - John is not discussing Jesus's essence here
2. Jesus "fulfilled" Christ prophecies ❌ - Already said in v14
3. Jesus brought the **fullness of God's grace** ✅ - Contrasted with "law through Moses"

**Best interpretation**: Jesus completed/supplied/fulfilled God's grace. Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ, whereas the law came through Moses.

This connects to "the word became flesh" - God's plan to bring grace was fulfilled in Jesus.

### John 1:18 - No One Has Seen God

This section provides detailed analysis of how modern translations add words to John 1:18 that aren't in the original Greek.

> No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, ***who is himself God*** and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known. — John 1:18 (NIV)

> No one has ever seen God. But the unique One, ***who is himself God***, is near to the Father's heart. He has revealed God to us. — John 1:18 (NLT)

**"who is himself God"** is text added by translators - NOT in the original manuscript.

Compare with older translation:

> No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. — John 1:18 (KJV)

#### Direct Translation from Greek

[The Interlinear Bible](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/john/1-18.htm) reads:

> God no one has seen ever yet [the] only begotten [god](https://eternal.family.net.za/god.md) the one being in the bosom of the Father he has made [Him] known.

#### The Greek Word "Theos"

The Greek word "[theos](https://biblehub.com/greek/2316.htm)" can mean:

- **God Almighty** (capital "G")
- [**A god or important person**](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/god.md) (small "g")

Depending on the translator's theological view, the same Greek text is translated differently.

#### The Contradiction

If John truly meant "God" (capital "G"), it creates a contradiction:

- John 1:14 - Jesus was SEEN
- John 1:18 - No one has SEEN God

#### What About Jesus's Teachings?

If the "only begotten Son" made God known, did Jesus teach about the triune God (Father, Son, Holy Spirit)?

**NO.** Jesus consistently taught that **the Father alone is God**:

- John 17:3; 20:17
- Mark 12:29; 15:34
- Matthew 4:3-10; 27:46
- Revelation 16:5-7

**Examples**:

- **Samaritan woman** (John 4:1-42) - Jesus said he was [the Messiah](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/christ.md), told her to worship the Father, reinforcing belief in one God
- **Disciples** (Matt 16:17-20) - Jesus taught he was [the Messiah](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/christ.md), reinforced that God the Father revealed this
- **Blind man** (John 9:35-38) - Jesus taught he was [the Messiah](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/christ.md), not God
- **Rich young ruler** (Mark 10:17-18) - Jesus corrected him: "Only God is good" (implying Jesus is not God)

#### The Key Point

Regardless of translation, the verse says "**he has made Him known**" or "**he has declared Him**."

This describes [**two distinct persons**](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/not-god/distinct.md):

- **The Son** (who declares/makes known)
- **The Father/God** (who is declared/made known)

**Problem**: If Jesus IS God, then how did God make himself known as someone else? This makes no sense.

**Solution**: The Son (Jesus) declared/explained the Father (God). They are distinct persons.

## "The Word of God" in Revelation 19

John wrote in the book of Revelations:

> Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The one sitting on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war. His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems, and he has [a name](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/name.md) written that no one knows but himself. He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and [the name](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/name.md) by which he is called is **The Word of God**. And the armies of heaven, arrayed in fine linen, white and pure, were following him on white horses. From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron. He will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. On his robe and on his thigh he has [a name](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/name.md) written, King of kings and Lord of lords. — Revelation 19:11-16 (ESV)

### Is This Jesus?

Many scholars agree this likely describes Jesus based on similar [prophecies about Jesus](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/prophecies.md). Some argue "the name" means "identity," proving Jesus IS "the Word of God."

1. **Authorship unclear** - No evidence "John of Patmos" is "John the apostle"
2. **Different genres** - Gospel of John = testimony; Revelation = prophecy (different language/context)
3. **Contradiction** - "A name no one knows but himself" (v12), yet "the name... is The Word of God" (v13)? If it's unknowable, how can John reveal it?

Revelation 19:16 clarifies what "name" means: **"King of kings and Lord of lords"** - This is **authority/title**, not a personal designation like "John" or "Jesus."

If the first (v12) and third (v16) instances of "name" mean **authority**, then the second instance (v13) should too:

> He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and the **authority** by which he is called is The Word of God.

### What Does This Mean?

**Analogy**: A police officer arresting someone acts on government authority. Without an order, the officer has no right to arrest. Similarly, Jesus acts **by the Word of God** (God's command/authority) to lead God's armies.

**Why this matters:**

- Jesus comes **BY God's authority**, not AS God
- Jesus acts on God's instructions (the Word/command of God)
- God's armies follow Jesus because he carries God's authority

**Implication**: We don't need to fear a rogue agent. Jesus will return as God's obedient agent, acting according to the instructions of a just God.

**Key insight**: This supports our earlier finding - "The Word of God" = God's command/plan, and Jesus acts according to it.

## Is the Word another name for Jesus?

Based on comprehensive biblical evidence, **"The Word of God" is God's plan, promise, and command** - NOT Jesus himself as a pre-existent divine entity.

### 1. Linguistic Evidence

- "Logos" means idea, plan, statement, command, promise, teaching
- NOT typically used to designate a person
- Appears 300+ times in NT, translated many different ways depending on context

### 2. How Biblical Authors Use "The Word"

| Author          | Definition                                  |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| John (Gospel)   | Sayings, teachings, prophecies, God's truth |
| Peter           | God's definite plan and foreknowledge       |
| Stephen         | God's promise announced by prophets         |
| Paul            | God's promise fulfilled in Jesus            |
| Peter (2 Peter) | God's promise (creation and future)         |

### 3. John 1 Analysis

When we read "the word" as "God's plan/promise":

- **No contradictions** ("with God" yet "divine")
- **Consistent with Genesis 1** (God created by speaking/commanding)
- **Aligns with John's purpose** (testify that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God)
- **"Word became flesh"** = God's promise materialized when Jesus was born

### 4. Revelation 19

- Jesus acts **BY** the Word of God (God's authority/command)
- NOT **AS** the Word of God (not claiming to be God)

## Common Objections

### "What About Colossians 1 and Hebrews 1?"

Some cite Colossians 1:15-17 and Hebrews 1:2-3 as proof that Jesus created all things, arguing this supports the view that "the Word" in John 1 is Jesus himself as a pre-existent divine creator.

However, both passages use language indicating Jesus as God's **agent** or **instrument**, not as the independent creator:

- Colossians 1:16: "all things were created **through him** and **for him**"
- Hebrews 1:2: "**through whom** also he created the world"

The Greek preposition "dia" (through) indicates **agency**, not direct action. God created through Jesus in the sense that all creation serves God's plan, which centers on Jesus. All things were made according to God's plan (the Word), which was fulfilled in Jesus.

Additionally, these passages must be read in their full context. Colossians 1 describes Jesus as "the image of the invisible God" and "the firstborn of all creation." An image is not the same as the origin. Adam was also created in God's image, yet Adam was not the creator.

For detailed analysis of these passages and their context, see [Is Jesus the Creator?](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/as-god/creator)

### "What About 'Before Abraham Was, I Am'?"

John 8:58 is frequently cited as proof of Jesus's pre-existence and deity:

> "Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am." — John 8:58 (ESV)

At first glance, this seems to claim Jesus existed before Abraham. However, several factors challenge this interpretation:

**Context matters**: The conversation is about Abraham seeing Jesus's day and rejoicing (John 8:56). Jesus is speaking about his **role** and **position** in God's plan, not his literal pre-existence. God's plan for the Messiah existed before Abraham. Jesus, as the fulfillment of that eternal plan, can speak about existing in God's purpose before Abraham lived.

**Greek grammar**: "I am" (Greek: "ego eimi") is a common phrase meaning "I am he" or "it is I." The blind man in John 9:9 uses the exact same Greek phrase ("ego eimi") to identify himself. He wasn't claiming to be God.

**Connection to Exodus 3:14**: While some connect "I am" to God's self-identification in Exodus 3:14, the Greek Septuagint uses a different construction there ("ego eimi ho on" = I am the being one), not simply "ego eimi."

**Consistency with John's Gospel**: Throughout John's Gospel, "the Word" refers to God's plan and message, not to Jesus as a pre-existent divine person. John 8:58 must be interpreted consistently with this pattern.

## What This Means for You

You've seen the evidence. The linguistic data, apostolic testimony, and verse-by-verse analysis all point to the same conclusion: "The Word" means God's plan, promise, and command. Not Jesus as a pre-existent divine entity.

So what now?

Read John 1 again, replacing "the Word" with "God's plan." Watch the contradictions disappear. See how it aligns with Genesis 1, where God created by speaking. Notice how it fits John's stated purpose: that you may believe Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.

Recognize what this reveals about God's character. He's faithful. He promised salvation through the prophets and kept that promise in Jesus. The Word became flesh when Jesus was born according to God's plan. God didn't become His Own son. He sent his Son to fulfill his eternal purpose.

Understand Jesus's role more clearly. Jesus fulfills God's plan; he doesn't replace God. He perfectly obeys and represents God's will, acting by God's authority. This makes his obedience and sacrifice even more profound.

> The gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh... (Romans 1:1-3)

The Word (God's promise) was fulfilled in Jesus. This is Scripture's consistent testimony from Genesis through Revelation.

John didn't write a riddle. He wrote "that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name" (John 20:31).

Will you let Scripture define "the Word," or hold onto traditions that create contradictions?
